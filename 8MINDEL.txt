$STEM The thing I can't wrap my head around is the current multiple relative to TAM given the multiples we're seeing in some of these other software names in HCM or Cybersecurity for ex.  Given Stem's position in this > 1T market, being one of the only pure plays on the software side, and the IRA pouring gasoline to accelerate this sector... I just think we've got some insane upside moves coming to us especially with profitability right around the corner in '24.

$TSLA $SPY and $VIX are both green. We are going to crash in the incoming days. I am thinking tomorrow since there is no spy options expiration tomorrow. Bulls, I would take profits today. When we tank, we tank much harder than pop. I don't have the position in either spy or tsla. I am only trading $TGT  strangle today as they are reporting tomorrow and because $WMT is reporting tonight and it's good for $TGT IV. Just a fair warning to the bulls. Take profits, guys. Bearish

$BBBY  $100++ easily by Wednesday.
The number below represents the total amount of FTD’s. Which is the total amount of shares they NEED TO BUY BACK. OVER 6.4M! Also look at the number of option calls ITM, on top of it already being heavily shorted! This was $80+ with a 120M float in 2021. We now have only 68M float. Same play like AMC was but this is much better smaller float! AMC had over 220M when it went $70+ ! Bullish

I could have make an very good quick trades as i use to do. $KOLD i have predicted  13s for this week and have reach only 12.96 and it now 11.85. We are just few hours in monday. So i still have a lot of time left to BOIL wull drop 80 this week and next week 70 and KOLD 13s and 14s next week. Soon or later NG will drop 7-7.5 aGain was 5.5 6 weeks ago and i have predicted -6 when it was 9.3-9.5 2.5 months ago. I have shorts BOIL UNG at that time and covers for like 15-25% of gains and missed 20-40% more. GLTA Bearish

@Spacerobot When OIL was 120-125  2.5 months ago i have predict under 80 bc price before the war and the war will be soon over and some Energy Bulls LOL. I have predicted OIL under 80 and NG under 6. NG was 5.5 3 weeks later and bc hot weather and Putin cut some NG to europe that why NG Bounce back and will drop aGain in a week. The Low of OIL was 87s few days ago and it have bounce to 94s and it now 87.4s aGain. I have make a lot of profit Shorting OIL and NG bulls etf and covers etc.. and Reshorts aGain and covers etc.. for OIL it was quick play so did not bother to post since few weeks. I Have Shorts $GUSH and covers at 143s and it have drop to 100  few weeks ago. But Since few weeks i am more on $BOIL is now 89.5 and i have Shorts heavy 93s and it will be under 80 this week and 70 next. $KOLD will be 14s soon. NG is much more expensive than OIL. GLTA Bearish

Notice the retrace is complete and the Jar has Filled >> 

Now that the pattern is completing a new pattern should emerge >>

Will it be a break above horizontal resistance or will the rally stall out in this zone???

$AAPL back to prices when it has considerable more growth, zero cost of capital, and friendly China relations.  Keep pumping guys, I need some cheap puts.  Not saying this will crash but it definitely needs to correct and consolidate.  The weekly chart is insane. Bearish
