$BBBY At the end of the day, an entrepreneurial journey is all about de-risking: How can you spend the least amount of time and money to accomplish your goal? The more information you can gather, the more comfortable you'll be investing time and money into a particular offering.

After being so utterly wrong for so terribly long in his judgments and recommendations on $KMPH, and after incessantly, shamelessly pumping the stock while it lost nearly all of its value, @doctor01 today flamed out at the very company whose ass he’s kissed all these years. Gotta wonder: Did Travis stop paying him?

One winning trade per month is likely to repay the $15/month cost of membership here by many 100X. For some, one winning trade a month can even contribute 1000X ROI for the $15/month membership here. My goal is to bring you at least one winning trade per month. 
 
This past week I have delivered two winning trades: 1) Last week's long in $LNG at below $150, closed today above $160; 2) Today's short of $BBBY at $26, closed today at $18.85 per share for a 30% 1-day gain.

There are roughly 400,000 total puts under $30 set to expire Friday at market close. 

That’s 400,000 x 100- roughly 40,000,000 shares shorted. That means 14,000,000 puts have been closed today ITM.

40,000,000 x $30 = 1.2 Billion that 🐻S Will lose come market close on Friday. 

If we are able to hold together and work together to get this thing priced at $30 + by Friday.

The price will double $60 + the Hedgefunds will be done for and BBBY WILL Turn into another GAMESTOP 2.0. 

It’s all math 🧮 the numbers are there just do a little research. Avoid the FUD, Block the bears 🐻 AND RESEARCH!!!

"the 2,300 nonautomotive design-in, 47% of them have already gone into initial volume production. So that's kind of normal. I think over the next couple of years, you'll see automotive step up as various different customers start ramping. And so, we'll obviously go higher than that from an automotive perspective over the next couple of years. But right now, it's more like 75%, if I got the number right is not automotive.  " Bullish

$BLUE In case anyone missed it, today was a 2 for 1. They haven't announced it yet but Eli-cel is 100% approved. The only outstanding risk after the unanimous panel recommendation was they failed the manufacturing inspection and since Beta-cel passed inspection, Eli-cel has as well. 9/16 is a lock.

@Yankees23 @stayretired Kazia should be trading in the $15-$20 range at this stage. $DAWN is another clinical stage bio comparable to Kazia yet it trades at $20-$25 and has a $1.8 market cap. They are focused on pediatric brain cancer.  I don’t get it but I think part of the problem is Kazia’s lack of exposure in the States. They have an amazing drug that is not getting properly promoted here. Bullish

$BBBY BBBY- even with AH pull back- the chart still looks solid, still have practically highest short float in the market, and Shorts are still trapped

Even with the pull back AH, chart still looks solid overall. And expect a quick rebound of AH drop- once ppl realize Ryan Cohen's position- regardless what it ends up being, doesn't matter now  (after the high volume of individual investors jumped on board and bought all levels of call options etc and accumulating shares). At this point his only impact is as a figure head.
B/c all the fundamentals for the gamma squeeze are in place & we still have one of the highest short floats in the market.

Why did they post it and expose it today? To delay the squeeze. To give the Heggies exactly what they wanted. For everyone to sell their positions. HILARIOUS. Y’all are fools. We had this squeeze. We followed the GME squeeze exactly from 2021. If y’all don’t see this correctly, then we are screwed. Gamma is coming soon either way. All y’all who sold will be sad or buy again soon.

$BBBY when I said be careful I meant it. I hope you didn’t lose too much and it can recover, don’t be too sad if you lost, it’s pet of the market . $MEGL  when I took profits people got mad but I said crash was expected( could be under $9.50 )and goes for another double) Will be watching to see if we can re enter. 
$JCSE was the trade of the day got in @$2.40s to $3+ 
PIK is the only one that didn’t made me money yet so I smell a big run here( like ATH $10+ maybe) No stop loss, sell orders are ; %40 of my shares @6.70, the rest can run anywhere it wants to run.

Will see how market goes tomorrow. Might get back in $AMC as well, as stop loss hit at break even today Bullish

Boston Children's Hospital says it's gotten violent threats over care for transgender children
The hospital said in an emailed statement Wednesday that its clinicians and staff have been harassed by phone, email and social media, receiving multiple threats of violence. The threats picked up after misinformation spread online that suggested the hospital performed gender-affirming genital surgeries on young children.

$BBBY Y’all need to understand, they LIED, Ryan Cohen filed to the SEC to be able to sell his shares in the next 90 days yesterday. NOT TODAY. Yesterday. Tuesday. Why did they post it and expose it today? To delay the squeeze. To give the Heggies exactly what they wanted. For everyone to sell their positions. HILARIOUS. Y’all are fools. We had this squeeze. We followed the GME squeeze exactly from 2021. If y’all don’t see this correctly, then we are screwed. Gamma is coming soon either way. All y’all who sold will be sad or buy again soon. He has January 2023 contracts, not shares lol. Get your facts straight. To the moon. #BBBY #GME #AMC @gme @bbby @amc Bullish

$BBBY we need to understand with more than 50% short, Ryan’s only 7M will not make a lot of difference but will definitely will run higher. If you look at yesterday’s 5min chart there was 10M sold. Take your call and if you are in profit take it, if you aren’t keep buying and holding. We as retail need to be on the same page just saying. It’s not fun to loose money. Hope you all understand that if you short it’s only the max you make is $10 on profit on every stock. Good luck all and good night

$BBBY look at the bonds. I’m planning on buying some. Priced for bankruptcy. It’s not a parabolic opportunity, but it’s a triple digit return op with a high yield. Any weakness tomorrow will only make them cheaper and lift the yield to worst. Don’t sleep on junk bond plays. Made a killing on AMC a few years back

Congrats to those who acted on today's TRADE ALERT to sell BBBY short at $26. Fading volume preceded a declining price to close the regular session at $23.  
 
Then the following bearish fundamental news was released into the market in the after-hours session, causing shares to drop another 18% to close at $18.85.  
 
The confluence of factors including a macro of an overbought market, along with a company-specific overvaluation on the chart, and a rug pull on the one fundamental catalyst driving momentum... the combination of these 3 bearish factors indicate for further downside tomorrow on 8/18/22.  
 
We are up nearly 30% on this short since we entered this morning, and anticipating further gains tomorrow.

A Florida appellate court blocked a minor's request to get an abortion
Florida, which currently bans most abortions at 15 weeks, requires physicians to notify and obtain written consent from a minor's parent or legal guardian before performing an abortion on the minor. Under the law, a minor is allowed to petition a circuit court to waive these requirements.

Americans are proving they know how to shop their way out of a crisis
During earnings season, we tend to see sectors move together. Walmart, a bellwether for retailers, had a great quarter. But then Target surprised everyone with a 90% quarterly earnings collapse. What happened? In short: Inflation is underscoring a key difference between the two big box retailers.

Brokers, the news media, and a few hedge funds are in on this. 
Hedge funds are buying out of the money calls and buying up shares. 
Brokers have been trying to coerce people into borrowing shares to take advantage of interest rates and profit from the market wide bear trap we're in. 
The news media is sharing stories to make retail noobs buy puts and borrow shares.

$BBBY I propose an alternative theory, RC could sell a portion of his shares to us at a loss just so we can drive up the value of his remaining position. A move that could be very profitable for him. Gotta think 3D chess people, always read the whole document and between the lines Bullish

@DayRip Yeah fuck head I’m a licensed rep I know what a fucking form 144 is you fucking idiot 

And it’s required if he ever wants to sell anything at all. Ever. 

So it doesn’t mean a fucking thing today. 

Combine it with the well timed FUd and this prick selling same time,
Shorts not covered, and what we have  is a very buyable dip. 

Thanks for playing fuck head

$PRTY  I have  done  extensive DD on them and this is the best of meme plays. $BBBY earnings are abysmal f them.  Party is entering their strongest season (last year posted positive 3-4Q) with this being the first real halloween since pandemic. They have 700+ brick and mortar stores so they have assets and the debt they own is safe and dated very far out. They should fix their ass website and do better to be relevant that’s my “Fix it” complaint. They also have had a large amount of calls and shares purchased by funds and their p/e is only 2. This has no business lower than 4-5 in a neutral market.

Bed Bath & Beyond Stock: Massive Short Squeeze Coming Soon (NASDAQ:BBBY)
During my high growth stock research, I came across Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ: BBBY) and noticed a massive opportunity for a huge short and gamma squeeze. This isn't just some stock pick that could go up 50% or 100% over the next few months.

🎯 I.S.T. Watchlist For August 18th 2022 (Thursday) 
 
👉 $SNPS : Synopsys earnings topped views while guidance also was strong. SNPS stock edged up in late trading. Shares fell 1.2% to 381, holding above an official 377.70 buy point. Synopsys stock already cleared some early entries in late July and is still well above its 50-day line. If shares pause near the top of the base, that could create a buying opportunity. 
 
👉 $CSCO : Cisco topped fiscal Q4 views and guided up for Q1. CSCO stock rose solidly in extended trade. Shares edged down 0.2% to 46.66 on Wednesday. Cisco stock rallied modestly from its early July lows, but is far below its falling 200-day line. 
 
👉 $COIN : Coinbase, which slashed its full-year forecast last week, closed near lows for the day as it fell 5.5%. Volume was lighter. The stock is still above the 21-day exponential moving average for now despite struggling so far this week. COIN shares are down more than 65% since the start of 2022.

🎯 I.S.T. Watchlist For August 18th 2022 (Thursday) 
 
👉 $AAPL : Apple stock rose 0.9% to 174.55 on Wednesday. The stock moved above a down-sloping trendline going back to early January. That offers a buying opportunity. The official buy point is 183.04. Investors could view the  stock chart as an awkward double-bottom base with a 179.71 entry 
 
👉 $SQM : SQM earnings were not yet out Wednesday night. Shares dipped 1.2% to 104.42 in regular session after skidding 5.1% Tuesday in a downside reversal. SQM stock is working on a 115.86 cup-base buy point after topping a 99.84 early entry last week from a too-low handle A proper handle would be ideal for SQM stock

$BBBY $AMC $APE I want to apologize for this post. I had no idea at the time that it was false information. Folks, we are up against a common enemy who has the entire media at their disposal, and that’s how they managed to get this fake story out. Cohen did not sell shares. But AMC fell with BBBY at the EXACT TIME THAT THIS NEWS CAME OUT. Why do they do this crooked stuff? BECAUSE WE HAVE ALREADY WON, AND THEY ARE DROWNING! We just need to continue to hold! 🦍 💪🏼

$BBBY Cohen gave you every opportunity to make a ton and get out before he dumped shares. Better bring those profits to $AMC now.

But to revenge them all, just stop feeding them $ and they will have to fight each other toward death and brutally wounded. That's why I'm staying on the sideline waiting to see retails get burned. They deserve it :) Wait till retails get burned, they abandon the market and mm, brokers, and trading platforms get broke. That's how to wreck all those fraudsters and idiots.

$BLUE added today, cost of treatment is a moot point. Insurances will pay, because there’s no other SOC (and people deserve care). Also because curative benefit mitigates “the lifetime cost of medical care for a patient with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia can reach up to $6.4 million in the U.S. and the average total health care cost per patient per year is 23 times higher than the general population.” Bullish

$GME It's honestly impressive how retail "apes" have been able to keep this from going under 10 (40 pre split). Problem is it takes big volume to pump. Market makers let this thing pump every now and then for shorts and giggles to open new short positons before they absolutely control the price back down. They have given up on the idea of bankruptcy, it's not needed, they are more than happy to let it run up 1 week per quarter as they cheers one another knowing the profit they will make shittanking the price right back down more than makes up for any borrow fees. They absolutely love that superstonk exists and morons keep talking about MOASS and pumping paycheck after paycheck into this shit. GG to those that catch the baby pumps and get out before shorts decide to bring it back down in 1/10th the time it took to pump.

Any "profit" could have made would have had to gone back to the company... so if you think get on at around $15 a share, sold around $20 a share, and just so he could fork over the money to the company he reduced his stake in.... well, keep posting here, you fit in quite well with all the ignorant chumps.

$BBBY read and understand this !!! 🫵🏼🫵🏼🤌🏼🤌🏼

thewolfofstock
8:40 PM
$BBBY ”Ask yourself why today? why right before close? RC filed that yesterday
So let me first say the form we've all seen by now is a formality that needs to be done for him to do anything with his options (roll them, sell them, exercise, etc.). Also he filed it yesterday.

So why the "hit piece" of an article that came out right before close along side a nice big 2m share dump at the exact same time?

The answer is - Because tomorrow is T+2 from the 8/16 run. Yall remember, the run from $16-$20.65. Well on T+2 the market maker has to hedge options from that day. There were roughly 120k options priced between $16 and $20. That's roughly 12million shares.

If the price is below $20, they no longer have to hedge the $20 calls anymore. Same if the price is below $19, no more hedging those calls. Also its a lot cheaper to buy 12 million shares near the $20 range than it is at the $28 range.

TLDR - buy the dip. This things going to bounce again tomorrow, probably hard.” Bullish

$BBBY ”Ask yourself why today? why right before close? RC filed that yesterday
So let me first say the form we've all seen by now is a formality that needs to be done for him to do anything with his options (roll them, sell them, exercise, etc.). Also he filed it yesterday.

So why the "hit piece" of an article that came out right before close along side a nice big 2m share dump at the exact same time?

The answer is - Because tomorrow is T+2 from the 8/16 run. Yall remember, the run from $16-$20.65. Well on T+2 the market maker has to hedge options from that day. There were roughly 120k options priced between $16 and $20. That's roughly 12million shares.

If the price is below $20, they no longer have to hedge the $20 calls anymore. Same if the price is below $19, no more hedging those calls. Also its a lot cheaper to buy 12 million shares near the $20 range than it is at the $28 range.

TLDR - buy the dip. This things going to bounce again tomorrow, probably hard.” Bullish

$BBBY May be a good size dip to buy on. Not sure these stocks fly around. Good to see memes screwing call sellers. They need a test every now and then. I used to sell calls and got screwed on GME. Before that, I was raking in cash and lost what I earned in 1 year in 3 days there. No harm no foul, it is what it is.
