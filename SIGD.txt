During my high growth stock research, I came across Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ: BBBY) and noticed a massive opportunity for a huge short and gamma squeeze. This isn't just some stock pick that could go up 50% or 100% over the next few months.

Bed Bath & Beyond soars another 22% premarket to lead meme stocks; AMC and Revlon pull back slightly
Meme stock Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. soared another 22% in premarket trade Wednesday, extending its prior-day gains and a winning streak that has seen it gain 59% in the week to date. Tuesday's rally came even as yet another Wall Street analyst downgraded the stock to sell and warned investors of "unrealistic" valuations.

JCSE is the next 100-200% opportunity this week dont be late !  
  
- IPO was priced at 4$ back in April  
- Was trading at 12$ last month and no reason for the drop.  
-  230% ctb, highly shorted  
- They just got a 700 000$ order on july 14th, one of many they have for this year.  
- Volume breakout yesterday with more than 3M volume traded (500% vs avg)  
- Got a lot of attention yesterday during regular trading hours + After hours!

$CTIC Two parts to this filing. A $200m shelf and a $100m ATM offering, which is pursuant to the $200m shelf. If they exercise the ATM in full, $100m will remainin on the shelf. Must wait for SEC to declare the S-3 effective before they can raise. 
Unfortunately, after it's effective, we won't be able to confirm if the ATM is being used until their next 10-Q filing.  
  
One thing to keep in mind. They had a previous ATM for $45m. That was initiated Jan 2021. However, they do not use it heavily until after the approval. From Jan-Dec 2021 they only raised $2.7m of the $45m available. They rest was raised after approval. They revealed in the 10-Q that the $45m ATM was fully exercised. No more money available to raise. 
 
So just having an active ATM doesn't mean they will use it right away. We just have to wait until it is declared effective and check upcoming 10-Qs to see if it is being used. 
 
Personally, I think this is housekeeping. Have it on file and only use it if necessary.

$FUBO Energy prices holding at a 6 month low is telling for inflation data. I also work with a lot of transportation/logistics and supply chain costs are down 10-30% on carriers in the US. We are in a bull economy, even if the analysts don’t want you to believe it yet. However we did cut forecasts at work and have an inventory glut. Those are two future risks I see. Bullish

Target profit plunges 90% as inflation-weary shoppers pull back
Retailers, including Target, have been forced to cut prices on general merchandise, such as clothing, electronics and home goods, because of excess inventory of goods. Consumers had to shift more of their spending to higher priced food and gasoline.

I went long 364 but started going short near 429, then added at 431 and openednew positions, that crash eod gave me a fat green balance ad then i reshorted at 429, didnt wait for 430 cuz the gap down was ganna be epic!

Or maybe the rally just continues today.

$ZIM This is simple. Dont put too much thought into it. Except the drop in price. Use the dividends in a few weeks to get cheaper shares rinse and repeat. 10 yrs from now the compound effect will be massive. I started with 70 shares in my roth now i have 130. Thars without me adding money. Thats just using dividends and selling a covered call (wen reaching 100 shares).

I.S.T Watchlist for August 17th 2022 (Wednesday): 
 
👉 $ORLY : O'Reilly broke out above a 748.78 cup-base buy point. The stock held modest gains of 0.6% in afternoon trading however and remained just below the proper entry. Shares are trading higher for their seventh-straight week as the stock powers higher. O'Reilly is also well extended above its 50-day moving average at this time, which could be a cause for concern. 
 
👉 $AAPL : The Apple stock price fell by -0.0924% on the last day (Tuesday, 16th Aug 2022) from $173.19 to $173.03. The price has been going up and down for this period, and there has been a 8.14% gain for the last 2 weeks. Volume has increased on the last day by 2 million shares but on falling prices. This may be an early warning and the risk will be increased slightly over the next couple of days.

$ES_F $NQ_F $RTY_F $SPY $QQQ Like I said, technicals are hot and a RED day, pullback was going to come. We were rejected immediately when the Nasdaq became overbought yesterday (while S&P and Russell where already overbought) and the S&P hit 200SMA.  Not saying this is a down trip yet, but absolutely a must cool-off for any further upside potential. 
 
Initial plan/thoughts for the day.  Short and trade down until around an hour before FOMC Minutes time, then we can see if we can get a rally back up to some level with some failure pattern setup.  Any meaningful support levels over the last few trading days are gone, so I am looking back to Thurs-Monday 08/15 lows as the first levels to check out. If that range breaks, start looking at the 08/10 close prices as the next go to for possible support level, to start a new range on the daily (leg before CPI)*

Target takes a hit after heavy discounts to clear inventory
NEW YORK (AP) - Target reported solid sales for the fiscal second quarter but its profit plunged nearly 90% after it was forced to slash prices to clear unwanted inventories of clothing, home goods and electronics. In early June, Target warned that it was canceling orders from suppliers and aggressively cutting prices because of a pronounced spending shift by Americans.

$AAPL 📣 Laying off recruiters, and subsequently reducing the rate of hire or additional employees, and increasing the quality of hiring production, is exactly what Apple needs to do and is bullish. This is a direct medium term to long term response to inflationary pressures, and is an intelligent response by the company during a time of slowed economic growth and repositioning of the company to continue innovation into the next cycle of high growth. It will come, these things ebb and flow. 

Bears who tout inflationary pressures to balance sheets needs to get a reality check, the charade is over. Masks off, except when you need to startle the flock again. Apple to $179 within 7 trading days, 📞 all the way up to $200 in December you hoho's. 

Any short term decline will only establish more support at a higher (but still with in yearly historical range 👀, supply zone.) Apple will finish green on the yearly, mark it. The squeeze is still on it's infancy, to the MOON I say. $SPY $QQQ

👉 $COST : Costco stock rose 1.3% to 553.02, just clearing a 552.81 cup-with-handle buy point. COST stock rallied on strong Walmart earnings and reaffirmed second-half guidance. But, earnings from Target on Wednesday and smaller rival BJ's Wholesale (BJ) on Thursday could swing COST stock. 
 
👉 $BBBY : The Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. stock price gained 29.06% on the last trading day (Tuesday), rising from $16.00 to $20.65. the stock finds support just below today's level from accumulated volume at $16.00. With no support from accumulated volume below today's level the risk is increased 
 
👉 $WMT : Walmart stock fared best on the Dow Jones, jumping 5.1% and gapping through its 200-day moving average. The retail giant attracted buying interest after beating earnings and sales views that were lowered twice in the last three months

When insiders sell shares, it indicates their concern in the company's prospects or that they view the stock as being overpriced. Either way, this signals an opportunity to go short on the stock.

Bed Bath & Beyond Stock: Massive Short Squeeze Coming Soon (NASDAQ:BBBY)
During my high growth stock research, I came across Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ: BBBY) and noticed a massive opportunity for a huge short and gamma squeeze. This isn't just some stock pick that could go up 50% or 100% over the next few months.

$QQQ, $FANG  Funny how the fear of a global recession selectively takes down commodity prices, especially oil, even while data showed LOWER U.S. crude and gasoline stocks?  Soon the reality of scarcity should drive up prices of oil (like it is already with nat gas).cnbc.com/2022/08/17/oil-mar...

Oil slips to six-month low as recession fears weigh
Oil hit a six-month low on Wednesday after a brief rally as concerns about the prospect of a global recession that would weaken demand overshadowed a report showing lower U.S. crude and gasoline stocks. Figures on Wednesday did little to improve the economic backdrop, showing British consumer price inflation jumped to 10.1% in July, its highest since February 1982, intensifying a squeeze on households.

$ZIM Amazing financial results once again. “Best ever first half-year results”. Increasing quarterly dividend payout from 20% to 30% of quarterly net income. Net income a year-over -year increase of 50%. “We are reaffirming our 2022 guidance, which would mark another year of record earnings and profitability.”

Keeping the facts above in mind, daily share price movement in the near future means nothing. Company is healthy, financially stable and profitable, with a great dividend on top of that. If you sell because of a 4% pre-market drop, you’ll have only yourself to blame later when $ZIM shoots up.
Be a smart investor and hold for gold, don’t be a towel with this one and sell because you’re scared of volatility. Bullish

Homebuyers are backing out of more deals as high mortgage rates persist and recession fears linger
Rising costs and falling confidence in the U.S. economy are fast becoming a toxic cocktail for the housing market. As a result, a growing number of buyers are backing out of deals they've made with homebuilders and sellers of existing homes. Homebuilder cancellation rates have more than doubled since April, according to surveys by John Burns Real Estate Consulting.

$ZIM if your worried about a recession hurting shipping your forgetting that air shipping is way down because of Russia issues and that China is about to do a big stimulus after locking their people down.  Only way to ship LNG is shipping only way to send large amount of commodities is shipping and there aren’t a lot of ships coming on line when they take a year to make a ship.    This dividend is safe for the next year IMO
