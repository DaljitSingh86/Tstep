 made a post on it earlier. Stand by it. Crypto is down right now, because Elon sold the bitcoins he said he wouldn‚Äôt sell. This guy needs to get his flip flopping head straight. I‚Äôm ready for a new leader. Someone who is t just blowing smoke up everyones asses. And yes he has a car. One design basically. It‚Äôs the model T of EV‚Äôs. And it wasn‚Äôt his invention, he funded two other people. Is he brilliant yes. But wtf. He has flip flopped his position on so many things, I stopped listening. Only good news is one day he might buy back at a higher price.

Selling Bitcoin after having hope in the future? Elon is to unpredictable. I‚Äôm sure the doge coin is a scam too: 

Eventually the lawsuits will catch up 

Elon was once a guy I admired . 
But between dumping Bitcoin . Voting for Biden . Sleeping with co workers . And being a fool on Twitter I‚Äôve had enough. I hope Tesla goes bankrupt due to Elon

What I find rather interesting is that when Musk bought Bitcoin, all the YouTube "experts" raved that this was the holy grail of crypto acceptance. And now that he has dumped a Billion worth at 29K? Well, now it's no big deal. O-kaaaay  .... 

You can't have it both ways. It sort of reminds me of Jim Cramer and when he whines about big mkt selloffs and blames the aglos and an unjust mkt that needs to be regulated. Yet, we can rip 150 handles higher and everything is functioning properly. Wall Street is a funny place.

You know what‚Äôs going to be fun? When all of the car companies start going EV, & people figure out that 
$TSLA
 is not a tech company but a car company therefore should only be trading at 8x earning.. how much is that per share again? Oh then Musk‚Äôs charade of a paper empire instantly gone. How far would that knock him down on the world‚Äôs richest people list??

Aww poor guy. No more cheating his cult anymore. 

I can‚Äôt wait to see him fall apart. Not for me- but for the bulls. Just make sure you take profit before he starts to crumble. 

Supply & demand, boys. The longer you are relevant the greater the chances you become irrelevant. These other car companies trading at respectable P/E‚Äôs are coming for you! And with better manufacturing, customer service, & cars that don‚Äôt kill their owners. 

Plus I‚Äôd take a Mercedes or Porsche EV over TSLA all day.

Ps - FSD next month & robo taxis debut in September!

Just a quick thought  .... 

Everyone seems to be turning cautiously bullish. And everyone seems to be pointing at 410/420 on the SPY as a next level which means we fall short or blow through. We never follow the mass. We are at an inflection point technically and with decent earnings next week the mkt could have a leg higher.  But today wasn't the day to be a buyer. Not at this inflection point. It was last week. For me, I want confirmation of a break above the downtrend otherwise we have yet another failed rally in this bear mkt. I've been bearish all year but when we get oversold, I do trade the bounce. Last week post CPI was that opportunity.  

I'll be back in the morning with my pre-mkt commentary for members to discuss new trading ranges and hopefully a new opportunity. Remember, have patience.  Be nimble.  ‚úåÔ∏è

Best guess is Flat or down 1%, BUTT looks like big money wants to push it up. Lots of Retail like us are buying Puts. 
 
We have some IWM Debit Put Spreads >>> Aug. 18 178/175 @ 1.20 a contract. will see what happens overnight. might have to take a 20% loss and reposition at higher strikes in September. 
 
IWM rarely holds it gains and retraces 50% pretty quickly. So we have a 1.35 Limit order in case it drops overnight. Looking for 8-12 % winners. trying to not get too greedy.

 I love the Tesla bears. They are losing their shit tonight. Vacillating between hyperventilating into a paper bag and screaming bizarre allegations of accounting fraud. Most hilarious part is that the fraud they complain of is based on their review of a properly disclosed BTC asset sale. Sorry bears, a charge of fraud cannot be sustained on the basis of a lawful disclosure. They need to try harder next time.

 Cybertruck deliveries beginning this time next year will confirm massive global demand for Tesla‚Äôs products. I expect another split at end of next year as Tesla reaches $3 tril market cap & $1,000 share price post 3:1 split. This was a horribly difficult quarter and they somehow still did great.  This quarter was the mother of all stress tests. Man this company has become really strong.

 Many on social media are saying TSLA profit is due to the bitcoin sale, when infact the bitcoin accounting actually made the profit less (realized loss on 75% bitcoin sold and unrealized loss on 25% remaining). 

This makes the $2.3B quarterly profit all the more remarkable, given all the headwinds in Q2.

The ~900M receipt from bitcoin sale appears on cash flow and balance sheet, not P&L. This is basic accounting.

 The worst is now officially over! Selling Bitcoin was a stellar move due to the impairment risk. 5,000 car run rate from each of Berlin and Austin end of this year and 10,000 run rate end of next year gives Tesla huge insurance against Covid risks in China.  Now we have the split coming and Shanghai upgraded. Congratulations to Tesla team on navigating the difficult quarter!

 Fkn rally was insane, came out of nowhere, correction coming:  
 
U.S. stock futures were down Wednesday evening as markets appeared to reverse course following two days of consecutive gains for the major indexes.  
 
At 6:30 p.m. Eastern time, futures for the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq were down 0.3%, 0.2%, and 0.3%, respectively. 
 
But this week‚Äôs earnings-season rally has come amid a general backdrop of poor investor sentiment. Bank of America ‚Äôs July Global Fund Manager Survey revealed ‚Äúdire levels of investor pessimism,‚Äù Michael Hartnett and Myung-Jee Jung, investment strategists at the bank, wrote this week. 
 
Weekly jobless claims also go live Thursday at 8:30 a.m., with 20 economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expecting 240,000 claims, which would be 4,000 fewer than the week before.

 not surprised Elon sold most of his bitcoin to fudge his earning report numbers and to have cash on hand. He has been quite vocal about the dire state of the economy and is preparing for prolonged pain. Laying off thousands of employees and raising vehicle prices is also not a good sign of "growth".

 Throughout history, poverty is the normal condition of man. Advances which permit this norm to be exceeded ‚Äî here and there, now and then ‚Äî are the work of an extremely small minority, frequently despised, often condemned, and almost always opposed by all right-thinking people. Whenever this tiny minority is kept from creating, or (as sometimes happens) is driven out of a society, the people then slip back into abject poverty.

This is known as "bad luck‚Äù.

TSLA Earnings: 
TESLA 2Q ADJ EPS $2.27, EST. $1.83 
TESLA 2Q REV. $16.9B, VS EST. $16.88B 
 
So if you look at TSLA the had a nice EPS beat and match on revenue... Now if you technically look at them and you see that strong resistance of 770-780(supply zone) AND 755 level. TSLA might be due for some more downside. Now are they just waiting for all the other techs to get upside, well that might be the case! For now, let's keep running them up!

Looking at SPY, I would say if we hold 3950 and push 3975 we might break out for 4000. Now you're definitely thinking... Bullish on SPY and bearish on NASDAQ. This could 100% change before tomorrow at market open. We just need to see where things open up! SPY above 3975 might give us some serious juice or serious weakness. So watch that level!

Guidance thatthe Fremont and Shanghai factories both achieved their highest-ever monthlyproduction and it is focused on a record-breaking second half of 2022 wasfurther music to the bulls' ears.

Mentioned: TSLA
We raise our 12-month price target by $25 to $1,125, based on a '24 P/E of 60x,justified by TSLA's long-term growth potential. We raise our adjusted EPSestimates by $1.30 to $11.90 for '22, $2.60 to $16.20 for '23, and $3.75 to$18.75 for '24. TSLA posts Q2 adjusted EPS of $2.27 vs. $1.45 (+57%), well abovethe $1.80 consensus. The beat was primarily driven by stronger-than-expectedgross margins, as revenue rose 42% to $16.93B (
$14M
 above consensus) and grossmargin expanded 90 bps to 25.0% (50 bps above consensus).

 Elon has burned every bridge possible on Wall Street and Main Street. Sold crypto he said he wouldn‚Äôt, backed of buying Twitter and then bashed the company, and pumped his stock in Nov ‚Äô21 and April ‚Äô22b and dumped his shares to unexpected retail for over $1000/share.  
 
Now in this ER he sold Bitcoin or else they would have reflected $1bn in loses.  
 
He's a lying scam artist. ü§°

 selling BTC is fine, the loss is not so good. It was an asset of the company, as an investment. It‚Äôs TSLA‚Äôs cash so selling for cashflow is fine, but anyone know how much they lost? In a time where cash is king, if it was a 30% loss, it‚Äôs really like a 60% loss for loss of time and use of cash for profitable uses. It was a bad investment and it hurts TSLA stock price. Red tomorrow and Friday $600‚Äôs by Friday EOD!

Okay, if we DO NOT OPEN ABOVE 12500 tomorrow... Be careful playing calls. Huge resistance! 
 
Outcomes: 
Bullish:  
12425 bounce -> 12500 
Above 12500 and supporting -> 12700 
 
Bearish:  
12500 rejection -> 12425 -> 12250 
Below 12425 rejecting -> 12250 
 
This is going to be semi tricky to play tomorrow but I think we can catch a nice bull-traps and get some nice premiums. The only this to watch out for it that fact that shorts are slowly dying out and buyers might start to step in. I think buyers will really kick in after next week when we have most the other BIG tech earnings!

 Classic Elon RUG PULL. Tesla had to sell bitcoin to prevent negative cash flow. Ouch. They had free cash flow of $621m for the quarter, but they had to sell $936m of bitcoin to achieve it. They took a huge loss on that bitcoin too from the price they paid to buy it. Sold at lows. Brutal. So what happens next quarter??? No more bitcoin to prop up earnings. Say hello to $300 a share.

 only reason this climbs now is because of a short squeeze. Elon Musk has already lied to this community about sending Doge-1 satellite to space Q1 of this year.

Still no word from him. He‚Äôs quiet as hell about it, even when asked.

And then only reason it pumped so high above 8 cents in the first place is because of how much Elon shilled it. 

Btw, Elon said he‚Äôs sending the satellite to the moon PAID BY doge. Meaning, he‚Äôs probably the one selling the most at higher liquidity price so he can gather the doge satellite launch funds. 

Also what did Elon manage to do during this whole market manipulation? He got the SEC and government involved to focus on crypto regulation. And he made you retailers feel like it is necessary. When in reality, no regulations is what MAKES it more profitable. Not less profitable. 

Elon has done nothing but harm the crypto community by breaking promises and getting the government involved. Fuck him and fuck

  No mention of a timeline for Semi or Roadster during the earnings call?  For a company that is purportedly sitting on billions of cash, why did Elon state that he was concerned with cash flow last qtr and decided to liquidate 75% of btc at a loss? How is no one  picking up on this accounting fraud? The company represesents it has over 18 billion in cash, yet Elon just stated during the conference call that he was concerned with cash flow last quarter so the company decided to sell BTC.  If you are sitting on 18 billion in cash, why would the company liquidate BTC at a loss of $250 million?

$MARA
 
$BTC.X
 
$COIN
 

My thoughts on where stocks are headed  ... 

In my pre-mkt commentary, I noted my interest in getting short MARA around the $14 level. It opened around $13.5 and within ten minutes was above $14 and I sent an alert out to members I was getting short (SEE BELOW). The stock would trade down 15% within hours to $11.90 and that's when I informed members I  want to lock in some gains. 

Heading into these past two days we were setting up to break a downtrend in the SPY. And where we closed today accomplished it. However, we tend to overshoot in both directions and the mkt is going to need follow through tomorrow to confirm such a break of trend .

Yes, this is a bear mkt rally. The real fireworks start next week. My guess is we are going to be a bit capped in this high SPY 390s until we hear from the "Generals" on earnings. Some tech has run a bit too much, too fast. 

Patience. Be nimble. ‚úåÔ∏è

According to BLS, the avg American in 2019 spent $6488/year or $540.67/month for Vehicle Purchase (net outlay) & Gasoline.  
 
In order to lease the cheapest 
$TSLA
 Model 3 RWD (base model w/ no customization) you would need to provide a $3800 down payment w/ annual miles of 10K to afford the same $540/month lease payment (numbers does not include any state/federal rebates) 
 
This does not include the expense of a home charger.  
 
Consumer Reports: 14% would definitely buy or lease an EV, 57% would consider one & 28% would not consider getting an EV. 
 
Top 3 concerns buying or leasing an EV, 61% said charging logistics, 55% said range anxiety & 52% cited the costs. 
 
Kelly Blue Book: The avg price paid for an EV in the US in May was $64,300 up nearly 15% y/y &  
$17K
 more than the avg new car price across all categories. 
 
-- Prices needed to come down to increase adoption & more charging stations. Will wireless charging the next big idea for EVs??

Don't forget that a couple years ago, many

Elon Musk said there's nothing to worry
about because it was just hardware blueprint
they stole. Not Software.

Elon has also proven to lie about a lot of shit,
broken many promises, and is showing red
flags of scam and market manipulation.
Who's to believe they didn't steal everything
they needed?

The thieves were Chinese who started up
their own EV companies.

Apple has the most cash at hand and doesn't
have "money furnace gigafactories" lol

Apple also didn't buy bitcoin high, and sell
low.

Apple also didn't break any promises to their
investors.

Tim Cook also doesn‚Äôt tweet controversial crap daily.

Tim Cook is also fascinated with bitcoin, crypto, and blockchain tech.

 CHICAGO (Reuters) -United Airlines Holdings on Wednesday posted a lower-than-expected quarterly profit, its first without U.S. aid since the pandemic began, as booming travel demand failed to offset higher operating costs, sparking a sell-off in its shares. The Chicago-based carrier reported an adjusted profit of $1.43 per share for the quarter through June, below analysts' expectations for $1.95, according to Refinitiv.

 So with all the problems of the last 6 months Elon: 
Beat top Line 
Hedged with bitcoin 
Predicts record breaking 2nd half. 
 
US about to pass chips act giving birth to factories that can supply Tesla with chips to help accelerate the  power storage business that is at record demand. 
 
Margin miss is a short term straw man. This is the worst the market has been since the pandemic started  & they weathered and they beat. If you believe market hit the bottom and there is nothing but blue sky's ahead for the next 6 months you are bullish on this.
