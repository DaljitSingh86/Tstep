$POWW this won’t dilute shares if anybody is wondering, they will split them by a percent , so 1 Poww share will be .70/.30 ammo / marketplace etc . Two reasons to do this imo , operational  , it’s easier to manage them  financially separately . What I  suspect though is that their trying to separate growth from their core ammo business because they anticipate bad numbers from the core ammo business , the margins were bad in last call and their deceptive on those numbers and the back order. basically they don’t want gunbroker attached to a cyclical  manufacturing business (what ammo is ) . If ammo sales are bad in the call today , it supports what I’m saying

$TBLT worst performer on my watchlist today. 
 
$MEGL  best performer. 
 
just swapped. bailed on the premarket accumulation of MEGL around 11:10 inthe mid $15s and grabbed TBLT for $4.90. 
 
Time to settle in for the afternoon to watch it unfold. 
 
FWIW, i'm looking for a support level on $MEGL. it bumped up against that $18 high from a few days ago, textbook. 
 
but the math still favors bulls, and i believe bears are sweating todays action. 
 
will probably buy back 30% position before 1600, for any AH or PM rodeo

$BBBY $100+ easily by Wednesday! 
The number below represents the total amount of FTD’s. Which is the total amount of shares they NEED TO BUY BACK. OVER 6.4M! Also look at the number of option calls ITM, on top of it already being heavily shorted! This was $80+ with a 120M float in 2021. We now have only 68M float. Same play like AMC was but this is much better.

AMC had over 220M when it went $70+ . We have a much smaller float then AMC’s now and then, this reminds me of the good old AMC days where I held $13 - $68. Bullish
