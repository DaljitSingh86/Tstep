Elon Musk is Worried about China
China controls 80% of the lithium market and Tesla needs a lot of lithium for its cars. But a junior miner just discovered a once-in-a-lifetime deposit of this "white gold."

See here why lithium could surge much higher.

$ARCT NICE! i get it now. So Figure A probably gives a better picture of the immune response.  
  
In that case this data looks amazing. I mean just look at the BA1 and BA2... The Immune response is the SAME from day 29 to day 181. How incredible is that???  
  
BA5 very similar. Look at that WIDE confidence interval. To me looks like that the immune response is not waning at all  
  
" In Figure A, three participants were removed from the day 181 analysis (n=9, day 181): two participants received off-study vaccines during the period between day 91 and day 181, and one participant has a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis with mild symptoms during this same period. In Figure B, three additional participants with suspected asymptomatic seroconversion were removed from the day 181 analysis (n=6, day 181). "

Did Ryan Cohen Sell His BBBY Stock?
On Wednesday August 17th 2022 after market close, SeekingAlpha and several other media outlets posted a fake headline that said Ryan Cohen sold his entire BBBY position. Panic ensued, which caused BBBY stock to crash nearly 20% during aftermarket hours.

$AAPL The last time apple went this vertical it sold off from 135 to 103 (Sept 2020 to October 2020). Thats almost a 30% sell off that occurred. That kind of a profit taking sell off to get it back to its typically growth trend line would sink $QQQ (its 8% of weighting), and by itself would imply 2.5% of headwind on tech, that's assuming that other megacap doesn't trade in sympathy -- which of course they would because all of them other than GOOG have similar charts currently. 
 
Here at a critical 200ma/top of bear market trend line, to me its a sign that its better to be bearish, but we'll see if there is continuation on the move after FOMC minutes on the profit taking today. Bearish

$BBBY $GME $AMC $HOOD  
 
Hear Ye Hear Ye fellow short-squeezers. I come requesting help in combating retched shorts in $ICPT. Alas, we continue to be mercilessly ravaged and pillaged like some old bar bunter with short interest reaching >40%.  
 
Yet the light of day is soon upon us as the tides of war are shifting. Though a small kingdom valued at only $500mln, we have plentiful resources of over $750mln in cash, generate >$350mln in revenues, on the cusp of profitability, have a relatively low outstanding float,  and have released positive data last month, with additional data being release in Q3. Finally, our lord commanders will be submitting a new drug application by EOY and be the first successful NASH drug on the  market.  
 
With thy forces, we will charge forward and reclaim glory for the land of Moon. Bullish

Here is what the  club thinks  We are buyers and holders!  
Did Cohen register his future sale so that when  BBBY squeezes higher  
he can unload instantly ?   He is very smart  so this may be the case .  
Also he only owns 9.5 million shares that is a drop in the bucket compared to the recent daily volume .  
 RAMPERS  bought more after the  media hype over nothing .   Media needs to tell the truth ......did he really file to sell okay when ? Bullish

$BBBY This is why you don't get greedy when it already ran from like $6 to $25+. Ryan Cohen selling his stake because he tripled his money, or more. $PETZ has a 2mil float and is moving higher. More volume and she rockets. Recent filings show Chinese entities hold 60%. Why? Because it is 2mil micro float and it is going to rocket.

$BBBY Careful here bulls. Never chase. Read the form 144 and keep your emotions out of it. RC Ventures can and will sell their entire position. That's not bullish. The real question is if Cohen is still holding those OTM Jan 2023 call options. Cohen and RC Ventures are smart. Be like them. Any competent money manager would have unloaded yesterday or taken some profits. Date of sale on the 144 is listed as 8/16. If more news drops or Cohen cuts a fart on twitter, sure this could run more. It sure looks dangerous here. With this level of SI, anything is possible. Don't chase and only invest what you expect to go to zero on this ticker. Good luck bulls and bears alike 
 
Per 144 rules "The amount of securities  that can be sold in any three-month period for  listed companies is limited to the greater of  
 (i) one percent of the shares or other units of  that class outstanding, or (ii) the average  weekly trading volume during the four  calendar weeks preceding the filing of a Form 144

This is still a HUGE squeeze candidate.  Nothing has changed since everyone poured in.  In fact, it is in a MUCH better position to squeeze.  It is still a play.  SO many bears are WAY under water here.  Are we going to just give up?

$BWV A correction is normal after a 199% run. This doesn't scare me. 
 
In case anyone's interested into other stocks as well for whatever reason, I recommend NVFY.      
     
It's a high potential stock with the potential to run to $2 this week. But it's also volatile, so please use proper risk management before thinking of an entry.     
     
Either way though good luck everyone, it's almost the weekend!🧡🧡🧡 Bullish

With 1/10th of the float of $BBBY and 1/4th the price, it could be the move apes dream of next. 
Everyone’s PT is 10 (near 100%), but with such a low float and outstanding shares, it could go much higher.

S&P 500, Nasdaq Futures Relay Cautious Optimism As Fed Speeches Loom; Cisco Takes Off On Earnings
Futures trading during the premarket hours is suggesting cautious optimism for Wall Street on Thursday, following the tech-led pullback seen in the previous session. On Wednesday, the major averages gap-opened lower and languished mostly below the flat line, although the FOMC minutes that suggested future rate hikes could be less steep helped cut some losses.

It's a high potential stock with the potential to run to $2 this week. But it's also volatile, so please use proper risk management before thinking of an entry.

This contrarian investor gave a timely warning for the last big tech top. He now sees the biggest drop of this bear market dead ahead.
When can we truly say goodbye to this bear market? While Bank of America's global fund managers are no longer "apocalyptically bearish," some on Wall Street remain wary. Add our call of the day to that last batch.
