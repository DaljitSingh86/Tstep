$RGS $SPY im no expert but there are to many things lining up to perfect for bears on the $SPX. Idk why but today feels like a huge bear trap. It will be red to max out as much premium as possible but I’m just wondering if it’s pure opt ex which will trap bears and add fuel to the continued rally. Big 3 days coming up in my world of trading with these three tickers $RGS $SPX $VIX

Citadel Securities borrowed $600mn on Thursday to bolster its balance sheet and trading business, capitalising on strong demand from lenders after volatile markets helped one of the biggest US equity trading houses make a banner start to 2022. The company, which is majority owned by billionaire Ken Griffin, forms a critical part of the plumbing of US financial markets.

I know there's a lot not to like about BIG Wall Street players, but you've got to admire one thing about them... They don't chase trades. FOMO is simply something they don't get caught up in. If anything, they create it! And when they're not creating it, they are fading it.

$ICPT @Kauai_Estate  i say no way momentum is taking this very fast imo after open. Shorts are in terrible spot the top most recent shorts already under pressure; there's 3 near term catalyst that can crush them and this company is flexing strength; this debt reduction is bad news on top. The majority of shorts that came in at $20 level are in very bad spot. Head fakes don't happen on volume/ whale transactions I am seeing.

Wall Street Sees Another Big Commodities Rally In 2022 | OilPrice.com
Even with now around $95, and commodities across the board dropping amid bearish economic prospects, a lineup of analysts still see another bull run by year's end. Earlier this week, oil prices fell to a low not seen since January, as traders weighed recession fears, China's slowing economy, and the potential outcome of a nuclear deal with Iran that would release more product onto the market.

$BBBY lol let me put on my tinfoil hat... 
RC bought the calls to let retail know: 
Ey this shit gonna boom but legally I can't tell you.  
 
and so that later, RC has no blowback or any lawsuits, he sells his whole position and isn't implicated in any way or form but also knows BBBY will benefit greatly from a squeeze and is its only chance of survival at this point, has to happen.  
 
GME also dipped what... a good 70% before it mooned? 
ALL hope isn't lost, we just need the stonck gods right now 🤣 
 
Not to mention $BBBY was highly held by institutions, so they also lost big money, more than us retail. 
Forcing them into a deeper hole than what they already are.  
 
If this manages to open green, expect wildness

I don't know how many times I've heard "dip before the rip", but never before have things felt quite so dippy before the rippy.  I've been waiting for a big dump on $BTC.X around a big dip.  We are slamming in between the high and lows of our trends lines.  Ape dividend is happening.  Market is taking a collective breather.  

As exciting as this would have been a year ago I think I am so used to this fluff that I won't feel again until generational wealth.

RC bought the calls to let retail know: 
Ey this shit gonna boom but legally I can't tell you.  
 
and so that later, RC has no blowback or any lawsuits, he sells his whole position and isn't implicated in any way or form but also knows BBBY will benefit greatly from a squeeze and is its only chance of survival at this point, has to happen.  
 
GME also dipped what... a good 70% before it mooned? 
ALL hope isn't lost, we just need the stonck gods right now 🤣 
 
Not to mention $BBBY was highly held by institutions, so they also lost big money, more than us retail. 
Forcing them into a deeper hole than what they already are.

Hedge funds pile up bets against the S&P 500's big summer rally
A more than $125 billion institutional short position has been building up against the stock market, driven by hedge funds, according to BNP Paribas. Futures contract data points to a sharp increase in the amount of bets against the S&P 500 index in recent months, even though the stock-market gauge has climbed nearly 17% from its mid-June low when it tipped into a bear market.
