$CENN What do we have now? A Jacksonville FL lease agreement to 2035. Overseas distribution Centers. A stupid court date for Aug 3rd? Approx $300M in the Bank, with now $60-80M in debt. Larger Market Cap with Warrants Available. Somethings up and I'm willing to wait and see.  I've always liked them mysterious cracker Jacks gifts inside, even those mystery grab bags. Still bullish and not desperate. So many haters. Europe Loves Cenntro. I can give a rats ass what kind of commercial delivery vehicle the U.S. desires to have. Theres too much White Trash in America and I'm White. I have 12 years served in the U.S. Army as a 15Q and served in Europe. They love these vehicles. Bullish

$CENN only thing I can think of is they used the $260mil to buy a company and now need money for working capital. Otherwise being that flush on cash makes absolutely no sense to dilute. Maybe that's why the stock didn't crash. Idk man. Longs need a hail Mary. My avg is at least below $7 now between all of my shares but for the mental anguish and anxiety this has caused me the last year and a half I better see $20+ minimum.

They‚Äôre a Profitable company which ended quiet period and are beginning to release news. Oh and it went from 28$ to 1$ FOR NO REASON. Last run it ran all the way to 3$. Just the beginning Bullish

BarkBox $10 SPAC current price 1.47
23andMe $10 SPAC current price 2.97
Sofi $15 SPAC current price 6.61

Sure, the market sucked a bag of shit, but that‚Äôs not all. It literally is a scam. They rely on most of the original shares changing hands, many time over, before it reaches the bottom and goes the other way. Keep in mind, that was the base price. Many paid over $20 for almost all SPAC‚Äôs in 2020 and 2021. Just because this was at one time a certain price, doesn‚Äôt mean if you wait long enough it gets back there. Sometimes‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre just screwed. Bearish

And yes there‚Äôs 100% more dilution coming in the future. That‚Äôs the goal. MILK investors, give the offerings to tutes SUPER SUPER cheap so they are instantly at profits, dump on retail, then reverse split if needed

no, i don't think so. he's building something big here. there's even more dilution coming down the line. of course, the higher the share price, the lesser the dilution.

THE CEO WAS GIVEN THE SHARES FOR FREE WHEN THE MERGER HAPPENED!!! Then the shares were locked up and just recently were unlocked.

THE CEO HAS INVESTED NONE OF HIS OWN MONEY INTO THE SHARES ü§£ü§£

NO TUTES ARE BUYING, EXCEPT FOR THE ONE THAT JUST GOT THE OFFERING. 

And the offering price is like 40 cents LESS than current price, meaning the tute that bought offering is already at MASSIVE profit! ü§£

Big tutes buying in. ‚úÖ 

Dilution? Yeah kind of sucks, especially when no one knows the real reason yet. However ‚òùÔ∏è, one must take into account that someone knows something when tutes and CEO are invested. 

I‚Äôm going to put my money on some
PR that‚Äôll rock the CENN boat. 

Maybe not tomorrow or next week, but it‚Äôs on its way. Bullish

$CENN this stock sucks, the reason it sucks is not the shorts, its the management, they just brought out another offering.  
A company run by parasites, that treats its investors like a crop to be harvested every 6 months. These parasitical assholes deserve to go bankrupt.

$CENN the fact the bulls are trying to spin the offering as positive brings back memories of the nakd/cennarmy bulls spinning the reverse split as positive and the merger being positive cause we would get a $50billion valuation‚Ä¶.

How did either of those work out for the stock?

@Stocksavior14 At this stage of their lifecycle and with the market only recently heating up quickly in favor of EVs, rapid growth is paramount.  Share price will come later.  This is not the right play if you are looking to get wealthy tomorrow!  This is going to take some time and that's ok.

$CENN I dont think the Bears realize we Bulls have alot of money invested towards not just CENN but many stocks in today's market. All stocks are a speculation and a gamble. We know that... "Investments" are a long hold of course, and we Bull Investors have transferred "excess" cash that we don't need today.. The mindset is (Yes) we know that our hard earned money can be gone some day. We can live without it, that's why we hold, and that's why we have invested our excess money. Unlike bears, including day traders like Jordan... Whom all Bears depend on day trades (Shorting), as a means to their income. How sad. Good Luck to everyone.  Don't gamble what you can't afford to lose. Chill on all the negative comments. Go hug or write a letter to your family member whom you have ignored for many years. Share what matters on here please. Bullish

Looking forward to the PR announcing their plans for all the money.  Very possibly entered into an agreement to buy someone out.  I guess we will see in the coming months!
