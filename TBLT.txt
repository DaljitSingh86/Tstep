Imagine getting into GameStop when it was $6 a share.  That’s where TBLT is today.  Main difference, GameStop had 140% short interest at its peak.  Toughbuilt has 280% short interest as of today.  Borrow rate is 200%.  Marketcap is 
$11M
.  2 million outstanding shares, float is 1 million shares.  A few big investors or a bunch of small retail investors sets off the MOASS here.

 If the current warrants expire in September of 2023, does that mean we will no longer be able to exercise them after that date? Or does it only mean that we can no longer buy and sell them, but still exercise them within the five year period?

 With 5 to 10 new products to be marketed this year. 
I predict that Revenue will double 75m to 150m ! We may just get the 75m just on this one product-THE WORLDS FIRST MAGAZINE FED RELOADABLE UTILITY KNIFE FROM TOUGHBUILT.@ $24 Walmart, Lowe's and Ace Hardware total stores 17,971 ./ 75M DIV $24 = 3,125,000 Utility Knives div 17,971 store = 174 Utility Knives per store to be sold to = 75m. Not even including the 5 stores that sell ToughBuilt Products. This is a general thought and not included % paid out. Fact is it will not be hard to sell. 
CEO said on May 23, 2022, we continue to strive to lower our losses and expect to launch five to ten new product lines and continue to expand our global distributions" 
Stores to purchase ToughBuilt Products! 
Walmart - 10500 stores, Lowe's     - 1971   "         " Ace Hardware 5500  
Amazon,Direct Ebay,Tractor Supply Co., Acme Tools & ZORO

 if you were the CEO would you bail out the shorts in return for millions in cash? Let's pretend that's 200% of the free float at a reasonable price say $6 a share for 5M shares I'd say this company could do a lot with that money. It's not like that can't just do another reverse split in a few years once they fail to regain compliance. If this squeezes to say $15 or even $30 there is no way they will be able to sell shares for that price because it will not be of a reasonable valuation. I know everyone wants a GME type squeeze but it's not going to happen. A private placement is going to drop in the not so distant future. The short is giving this company great advertising and a reason to bring in cash. It's a win win for everyone except the retail chaser who is going to fund the majority of this operation. Before you attack me full disclosure I was in at 2.12 sold half at 5.40 from here I'm selling at $9, $12, and $25 if I can. If not selling the offering dead cat bounce if I can

 if you want the squeeze to happen then get on Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, etc and blast this stock all over.  Short interest is already at 280%.

They’re a Profitable company which ended quiet period and are beginning to release news. Oh and it went from 28$ to 1$ FOR NO REASON. Last run it ran all the way to 3$. Slap now or chase later.

 Guys shorts are in trouble 
Same action on my piece of shit company 
GameStop I brought 9909 at 5.69 a share 
So knowing what you own is critical in playing the game 
GameStop was going bankrupt when I brought 
I keep seeing their assets in the buildings they owned 
Needless to say 
I put the stock out at 200.00 a share 
Same thing here 
When I listed my shares gtc 
I said maybe just maybe 
I sold at 55
Two months 500
Can you imagine 
Well in conclusion everyone should buy this hard on any pullback 
Real company selling goods making revenue 
As home price decline more homeowners will hire construction crews to fix their homes cause they are in at low mortgage rates 
This business will continue to grow given the slowdown in Real-estate
People will fix their homes more construction equals more revenue 
Toughbilt just did a 1 for 150 shares 
Shares outstanding?
Float?
How many more shares can be issued? 
If 4 m os
1 m in float 
3m offering possible 
They went do it at these prices

Every penny stock company should do multiple reverse splits to shrink the float and then wait for these squeeze traders to jump on it. They don't need to actually create shareholder value. This company had a 1-10 split in 2020 and a 1-150 in 2022. No wonder why the float is so small. Welcome to the new market.

 43% on the day including AH.  Not freakin’ bad after a couple days of run… 

Sometimes the numbers and charts and, the power of people (meaning individual investors/traders) cannot be ignored.  Which, for me as a very traditional buy-and-hold guy, is… well, more than a little inspiring. 

Thanks to (you know who you are) for pointing me here. And, thanks to y’all for the continued inspiration and education. I’ve been averaging up (and holding 80%) day over day - but, this is a rare/fun one that I’m taking to however high it goes

 seen a lot of people saying it ran up so they are avoiding.  Really smart.  Like when GameStop ran from $4 to $20 it would have been really smart to avoid it.  Then you missed the run to $400.  This is going to $100 if people have diamond hands.  I put $20k into this today.  $5.25 average price.  I’m not selling at $10 nor $20.  Why sell for the profit of a car when you can hold longer and sell for the profit of a house.

3.3 months down 76%
4. 1 year DOWN FOOOKKIINNGGG 95%
 Just HOLD and self reward yourself. Stop wasting all that unnecessary mental energy that leads to physical frustration.

6-7x market cap in cash reserves

Revenue growth is very positive

Cash on hand is increasing

SI over 200%

80% to darkpool still up 35% 😳

This is because a group of people own the float and are not trading it. At 2.10 it would have taken less than 
$4M
 to buy the entire float of a company making fucking cash with increasing revenue. Just think about that for a minute….

Well-known company with good products. Reported great second quarter earnings just from Amazon sales alone already. No options chain! Shorts cannot make residual money off their losses. They must buy back soon!
