Bro you don't understand! No gaps below. 866 gap above. Filling 866 also sets POS up for a chance to reclaim the "uptrend of the whole move", after which it's anyone's guess. Bears unable to maintain IV going into this week (puts are going to get burned). Also, skew is decreasing while short term IV increasing, which suggests demand for short term calls.

I think TSLA us going to 450 or so. Maybe lower but this was the original target and makes a lot of sense in the context of current patterns. First gave this target for TSLA around 1,100 where I speculated TSLA was a bubble setting up to pop. If it is going to pop, we'd be heading into the latter stages soon - which is an soft way of saying "Capitulation".

This morning I opened a long on Tesla. Entry around 680 and target between 850 - 870. SL below 610. In my opinion a good risk reward ratio at the moment. When the target is reached, I will keep an eye on whether the price will be rejected here. This would potentially create a head and shoulders formation and provide an opportunity for a short position.

With momentum still looking bearish, but lots of consolidation and mini higher highs, we can see a bullish move! The "Earnings and Revenue" is coming up, so this could be the spark of this move. Be careful, this is trading against the trend. Don't make a move until a break and retest happens.

Bull case: TSLA goes to $770 then retests $735 and goes to the top of the main channel, $880-$900 Bear case: TSLA cannot break $735, goes back to low $600. No matter where it goes, TSLA is at a very curios place.

Could be wrong but this is what I’m seeing on TSLA today. Forming a falling wedge right at the handle of this cup and handle. The current pre market bounce is also occurring at the previous breakout resistance indicated by the two circles. I also found that this wedge is forming between the 61.8% and 78.6% fibs. Lastly, all of this is in confluence with the...

Good morning all! This morning we will try to do an analysis to see if the market will continue to fall or if we will have a reversal of the trend. As you can see on the graph we are still in a downtrend and we will not go against this trend. . We will keep a close eye on this one because we are below the vwap indicator. This continuity of decline can only be done...

Tesla made a leap and exited the Ichimoku cloud. After a three-month decline in quotes to the level of $600 per contract, Tesla made a growth spurt and broke through the trend line of the long-term downward channel. The situation was significantly changed by the Chinese market and sales growth in June was 142% and 135% higher than in the same period in 2021, as...

On the H4, with RSI moving along the ascending trendline and price moving within the ascending channel, we would have a bullish bias that price will rise from buy entry at 707.48 where the pullback support is to take profit at 792.28 in line with swing high resistance, 100% fibonacci projection and 50% fibonacci retracement . Alternatively, price could drop to...

The market turmoil today alongside the twitter drama caused the stock to drop nearly 7%. The health of the stock will depend on the overall market & the CPI report that's coming out soon, but I believe a run to $800 before earnings is imminent after the symmetrical triangle that was broken upward yesterday. Not financial advice, good luck to all :)

TSLA valuation remains too high and IS going to be subject to some additional repricing and technical chart restricting. Target 1 is 647 and you can see the other targets on the chart. Current price is 741.32. This is also going to playout based on the related idea below that I have linked.

As you can see on the chart we have an intersection between the resistance line and the support line. On top of that we are in an uptrend. In such circumstances we will not go against this trend. In addition, on this chart you have to keep an eye on the support line because it is more important than the resistance line. However, if the support line is broken with...

Hi traders, Overview: lets review my expectation on July 3rd update: "currently we are in wave 4 of leg (C). I see wave 4 developing as a triangle, where waves d and e are yet to be completed." Update: I am now making a slight change to my tsla count, where I am considering an ascending triangle developing as wave IV instead of a symmetrical triangle.

Tesla stock should now be in a downtrend. The moving averages have all shown a short arrangement, and the amount of energy is shrinking, and the macd has also shown a serious divergence. In the first half of 2020, when the volume increased, the volume was matched with the transaction volume, but the volume of the increase after the end of 2020 is gradually...

I believe Tesla is bullish in the SHORT TERM; it broke many resistance lines this week, and momentum is trending up , especially with the Musk aborting twitter deal. A good strategy, assuming No new negative Macro-econ news over the weekend, i expect itto break over $800 per the elliot wave, possibly this monday, if no gap down pre market. Taking a weekly $800...

TSLA is an interesting story. And in any story, the only thing that matters, is data. As you can see on the all time volume profile on the left, we are currently building volume interest at a higher point. There is no interest in taking tesla all the way back to the yellow line, which is the original point of control (POC) based on volume interest. We also see...
