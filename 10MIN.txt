@momomiester all led by $AAPL . I wonder how bad earnings have to be to matter anymore? Earnings deceleration is the new transitory unless we have some wage price spiral. Either way everyone losses either through inflation eating your standard of living away or a prolonged recession/depression.

More Apple ads üì≤ 
 
Reportedly, $AAPL is looking to boost ad revenues and is planning to expand its ads placements to apps like Apple Maps, Apple TV+, and Apple Books. According to Bloomberg, Apple generates roughly $4B in ad revenues annually. The company doesn‚Äôt report this separately.  
 
As an app developer, I can assure you that Apple will find many creative ways to add more ads to the iOS ecosystem. IMO, it‚Äôs only a matter of time until the main iPhone search bar gets ads, as well as the Today View where the widgets are located.   
 
Relentless company. First, they severely cripple competition like $META with "privacy" changes, and then they expand their own ad network. Also, let‚Äôs not forget the deal with $GOOG, which basically pays Apple up to $15B per year to stay out of the search engine business.  
 
To summarize, it's likely that Apple advertising will be yet another segment with double-digit growth over the next years. Good for shareholders.

ARTL: Has a public float of only 1.9 million shares and numerous price targets of $55.00/share.  It is currently trading at $3.85.    
  
CARV has a tiny float and has a history of running hard on massive volume, but it hasn't run hard yet this year.

$QQQ it‚Äôs like I‚Äôve been saying. Market is timed to set calendar days and set at monthly intervals for the opposite direction. Thinking every little bad or good news story has an effect is flawed thinking.  It has to play into the bigger narrative of the timing. They gave the signal 6/14

@TraderJ50 So I've decided that i'm not selling any more $Stem but not buying anymore either unless it drops back to the 200 day ma then I'll probably double my shares for the long hual... Still have my doubts that $Stem will finish the year above $14 but I'm convinced that my PT for 2024 of $33-$36 will easily hit.

When counterfeit shorted companies like $GME and $BBBY go up, the short rats and their prime brokers scurry back to the FED for reverse repo collateral to use to stay alive on their infinite risk short positions. Why do you think reverse repo rates went sky high after Jan 2021?

$Z If it falls again, I highly doubt it drops below $29/30. That‚Äôs where I buy more. 

If that fails, I load up at $24. 

Otherwise, obviously watch for an amazing buying op at $16-17 near ATL‚Äôs, and anything below that for a lifetime extremely oversold territory between $9-12. 

If it drops that low tho, literally buy anything and everything that hasn‚Äôt gone bankrupt yet lol. I think at that point, markets would imply everything is oversold at that point, and ready for the next 10-20 year cycle of straight perma bull unlike no other. üí™ 

This is a simple chart to evaluate how overall market conditions are to me, IMO. That‚Äôs why I say that. 

$SPY $QQQ

Good news is, if we DO drop to new lows, I think it‚Äôs true; this recession honestly may be more quick and painless than I thought. 

The recovery would be a teeter totter, as all recoveries usually are‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôll be perfect time for accumulating‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôll be volatile rather than flatlined, so great trading possibilities still. üëå

$BBBY $100+ easily by Wednesday! 
The number below represents the total amount of FTD‚Äôs. Which is the total amount of shares they NEED TO BUY BACK. OVER 6.4M! Also look at the number of option calls ITM, on top of it already being heavily shorted! This was $80+ with a 120M float in 2021. We now have only 68M float. Same play like AMC was but this is much better smaller float! 

AMC had over 220M when it went $70+ . We have a much smaller float then AMC‚Äôs now and then, this reminds me of the good old AMC days where I held $13 - $68. Bullish

$BBBY If anyone is wondering it they are "too late" ... it appears this a staying power and moving much higher...

1) 2nd highest short float on the market,  #1 on Fintel  "Gamma squeeze Leaderboard " and 

2) most important for actually seeing the squeeze happen: it has backing of an activist investor (ryan cohen). ..GME squeezed 5 months after Cohen disclosed a 10% position (he disclosed a 10% position in BBBY in March).

Although BBBY prelim move up is happening quicker than the original GME prelim move up (bc in the post-GME world, the process is accelerated as more ppl are now familiar with "gamma squeezes") ... the charts show a similar prelim pattern.

Once it starts the 20-30% up days again... the ppl who are familiar with or jumped in the AMC,GME,KOSS,etc squeezes- will recognize the BBBY squeeze is the real thing, with all of the necessary ingredients- and they will quickly jump on board, providing the volume needed to send it into Squeeze range.

$SPY >> if you're like now is the time ‚è≤Ô∏è to jump in this rally with $DIA & $SPY RSI's above 70 on the daily chart & $QQQ @ 68 and almost 70 you are chasing üêëüêëüêëüêë

Easy money üí∞ has been made on this run üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

There are unfilled gaps just below and the indexes are on a multi day run üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 

Yeah, you can chase üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è here if you're a day trader for quick flips, but people are not going to put new money ü§ë to work here with everything overbought temporarily 

I could be wrong, but that's what I'm thinking at the moment ü§î
