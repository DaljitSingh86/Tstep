$BBBY The only thing that can keep us from shooting past $50 today will be our not holding and using Stop Losses that get triggered by ladder attacks.  The shorts already know there are a lot of you setting Stop Loss because they keep doing it to you every day.  Wouldn't it be nice if we just had one day of no Stop Loss hits to prove our point?  HIGHER highs, higher lows, means MO MONEY!!!  Diamond Hands... Bullish

Overcrowded now on the long side.  
 
First day of CRM's first investor days (dreamforce) as a publicly traded company is on Nov 1st-4th, 2004. Stock peaked and started dumping on Nov 2nd, 2004 for a few days. Take note that this is not an exact comparison, CRM's very first investor days (dreamforce) were in 2003, they were not publicly traded yet then. 
 
Tesla's last two investor meetings (Oct 7, 2021 and Aug 4, 2022) resulted to dumping the following day. 
 
Set your stops depending on your risk tolerance in case the pumpers are successful. Bearish

I don’t know what’s the incentive to even upgrade to the latest version nowadays. It’s always the slight improvement in camera. Bearish

🧠With Olive, I find strategies using Filters. The ceiling filter sets max/min gain potential and can be combined with other filters like cushion and OliveScore to find the best returns with volatility protection builtin. This outcome is found when searching for OliveScore >60, Ceiling >13%, Cushion >10%. This variable return strategy for $ZIM

Make up to 36.7% (24.5% annualized) 

ZIM can fall 46% before you start to lose.

Look at what  TGT and TJX earn in an annual basis.  

Then look at $SIG (making over $11 per share).  

SIG could double in price and be a better value.    Not complicated.

If you want a bargain buy SIG.  It's not even close.  Do the research and do some math and you'll see.

Yesterday's #ShortSqueeze (double digits) gains for $APRN, $KIRK, $BBBY may continue today since they are at the top at Fintel's #GammaSqueeze List.

$KIRK is #2 out of 345 stocks with the highest likelihood of experiencing a Short Squeeze, according to Fintel. 

$KIRK is #19 out of 5336 stocks with the highest likelihood of experiencing a Short Squeeze, according to Fintel. 

From June 16 to August 12, short interest in the U.S. stock market increased by $125.7 billion, or roughly 14%, according to technology and data-analytics firm S3 Partners.

Just reporting.  I have no position on $APRN, $KIRK or $BBBY.

$SLS Long vs Short trend continues to show massive divergence and indication of the trend that is to come. 
 
Combined with the massive institutional inflow from the recent 13Fs including Empery starter of 928K, Alyeska starter of 254K, Highbridge starter of 100K, and many more. Huge for only 20.5 million float. fintel.io/n/us/sls 
 
Recent hiring of the new CCO (chief commercialization officer) and the new board member's first statement yesterday,  “SELLAS is preparing to become a commercial stage company and I look forward to working alongside my fellow Board members and the management team at this exciting time for the company.” 
 
The fact that they are continuing to hold the market cap at $64 million while they accumulate is absurd, market cap for this late in phase 3 should be a minimum of $500 million, at a minimum. 
 
$MRK or $BMY need to pull the trigger before commercialization is reached and price is 25-50x.
