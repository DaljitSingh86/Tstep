$BBBY The only thing that can keep us from shooting past $50 today will be our not holding and using Stop Losses that get triggered by ladder attacks.  The shorts already know there are a lot of you setting Stop Loss because they keep doing it to you every day.  Wouldn't it be nice if we just had one day of no Stop Loss hits to prove our point?  HIGHER highs, higher lows, means MO MONEY!!!  Diamond Hands... Bullish

Overcrowded now on the long side.  
 
First day of CRM's first investor days (dreamforce) as a publicly traded company is on Nov 1st-4th, 2004. Stock peaked and started dumping on Nov 2nd, 2004 for a few days. Take note that this is not an exact comparison, CRM's very first investor days (dreamforce) were in 2003, they were not publicly traded yet then. 
 
Tesla's last two investor meetings (Oct 7, 2021 and Aug 4, 2022) resulted to dumping the following day.

Target's Results Cap Upside Potential For Retail Stocks
Target's (NYSE: TGT ) Q2 results reinforce a problem facing the retail sector that was only hinted at by Walmart ( NYSE: WMT ) and Home Depot ( NYSE: HD ) earlier in the week. The company's efforts to combat supply chain and inventory hurdles are catching up with it at the same time that demand is falling.

SIG could double in price and be a better value.    Not complicated.

If you want a bargain buy SIG.  It's not even close.  Do the research and do some math and you'll see.

Bed Bath & Beyond Stock: Massive Short Squeeze Coming Soon (NASDAQ:BBBY)
During my high growth stock research, I came across Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ: BBBY) and noticed a massive opportunity for a huge short and gamma squeeze. This isn't just some stock pick that could go up 50% or 100% over the next few months.

Yesterday's #ShortSqueeze (double digits) gains for $APRN, $KIRK, $BBBY may continue today since they are at the top at Fintel's #GammaSqueeze List.

$KIRK is #2 out of 345 stocks with the highest likelihood of experiencing a Short Squeeze, according to Fintel. 

$KIRK is #19 out of 5336 stocks with the highest likelihood of experiencing a Short Squeeze, according to Fintel. 

From June 16 to August 12, short interest in the U.S. stock market increased by $125.7 billion, or roughly 14%, according to technology and data-analytics firm S3 Partners.

Just reporting.  I have no position on $APRN, $KIRK or $BBBY.

$SLS Long vs Short trend continues to show massive divergence and indication of the trend that is to come. 
 
Combined with the massive institutional inflow from the recent 13Fs including Empery starter of 928K, Alyeska starter of 254K, Highbridge starter of 100K, and many more. Huge for only 20.5 million float. fintel.io/n/us/sls 
 
Recent hiring of the new CCO (chief commercialization officer) and the new board member's first statement yesterday,  ‚ÄúSELLAS is preparing to become a commercial stage company and I look forward to working alongside my fellow Board members and the management team at this exciting time for the company.‚Äù 
 
The fact that they are continuing to hold the market cap at $64 million while they accumulate is absurd, market cap for this late in phase 3 should be a minimum of $500 million, at a minimum. 
 
$MRK or $BMY need to pull the trigger before commercialization is reached and price is 25-50x.
