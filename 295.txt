Senate Bill to Boost Chip Production, Advanced Technology Set to Move Ahead
WASHINGTON-After weeks of uncertainty, the Senate is ready to vote Monday to advance a far-reaching $280 billion bundle of subsidies and analysis funding to shore up U.S. competitiveness in superior expertise. The invoice had all however collapsed earlier this month amid partisan bickering, then got here collectively in a matter of days.

For many small businesses, access to funding can be a matter of life and death. The stakes are especially high given that 18.4% of U.S. businesses fail within the first year, 49.7% after five years and 65.5% after 10 years, according to a LendingTree analysis of data from the U.S.

Retail Armageddon all over tomorrow. TARGET will show similar #s. 

Inflation is killing the consumer, but only one class of consumer, certainly not hurting the ultra rich consumer (3 tier middle class + part of middle lower and upper lower class).

One more reason why, bull, you will see a 1% hike on Wed. @ FOMC meeting. Yep. Will happen. Walmart just bumped up that 20% chance to CLOSE TO 50% I bet, it sure should.

I have a question, would the offerings given to private institutions would be available to public if they sells them. 
 
Anyway, I hope everybody has planned their way out. 
 
I am holding shares with an average of 7.39, how low it can go, $1 ? As I can afford to double up, will do  on $1 , wait for it to become $2.  I am not going to realize loss. 
 
 
Market forecast - I guess Inflation already had a bottom last month, there might be an interest rate hike on this FED meeting, however next CPI ( July) report would be better and we head upwards.

Listen here folks! This is the greatest and fastest economic recovery of all time and it is the direct result of  Biden working tirelessly to stop Putin's price hikes and inflation and racism and transphobia too.  Unlike that racist idiot Trump who golfed all day, Biden is working around the clock to lead this great country to better days. Just imagine how bad things would be with that orange racist bigot still in office.  The NASDAQ would be down over 90% and we would all be speaking Chinese or Russian. 17 out of 17 nobel prize winning economist agree that the Biden Boom is here and that the economy is stronger and more diverse than ever before. The recession is fake news.

How Much Does It Cost To Charge an EV on a Road Trip?
With many electric vehicles (EVs) now boasting ranges of more than 200 miles per charge, it's easier than ever before to go on a road trip. The only complication is that for all but the shortest road trips you'll have to charge your vehicle. Calculating the cost of that can be tricky.

Senate Bill to Boost Chip Production, Advanced Technology Set to Move Ahead
WASHINGTON-After weeks of uncertainty, the Senate is set to vote Monday to advance a far-reaching $280 billion package of subsidies and research funding to shore up U.S. competitiveness in advanced technology. The bill had all but collapsed earlier this month amid partisan bickering, then came together in a matter of days.

Listen here folks! This is the greatest and fastest economic recovery of all time and it is the direct result of  Biden working tirelessly to stop Putin's price hikes and inflation and racism and transphobia too.  Unlike that racist idiot Trump who golfed all day, Biden is working around the clock to lead this great country to better days. Just imagine how bad things would be with that orange racist bigot still in office.  The NASDAQ would be down over 90% and we would all be speaking Chinese or Russian. 17 out of 17 nobel prize winning economist agree that the Biden Boom is here and that the economy is stronger and more diverse than ever before. The recession is fake news.

Separately on Monday, Digitimes reported that Apple (AAPL) has asked iPhone suppliers to scale up components ahead of the next launch, slated to happen in September, citing supply chain sources. 
 
Cupertino, California-based AAPL is slated to report fiscal third-quarter results on July 28. The company previously said that Covid-related lockdowns, as well as supply chain disruptions, would impact revenue in the period anywhere between $4B and $8B.

 Foxconn ($HNHPF), the maker of Apple's ($AAPL) iPhones, as well as 100 of the largest companies in China, have been asked to operate inside a "closed loop" for seven days in Shenzhen, China as the city battles another outbreak of COVID-19. 
 
Bloomberg reported that other companies, such as Huawei, BYD Company Limited ($BYDDY), ZTE and drone-maker DJI were asked to limit their operations only to employees inside the loop and have little to no contact beyond that network. 
 
In addition, Chinese government officials have asked the companies to limit unnecessary interaction between manufacturing staff and non-manufacturing staff to limit infection, the news outlet added. 
 
However, Foxconn said on Monday that operations at its Shenzhen manufacturing campus were normal, but added the company would follow government guidelines to ensure prevention of COVID-19 and continue production.

But seriously now folks, one thing I've learned about trading is that it's good to have a plan and stick to it. My plan for these stocks hasn't changed since I bought them. Can't let the day to day get you stirred up. Shaken maybe but not stirred. 
 
In other news I got banned for a while today for cussin. So now I have to be careful, and I hate it a lot. I don't even really want to participate anymore. Also I had frequently been posting a gif of a gorilla banging another gorilla, really giving it to her, with a gratifyingly twerkish motion, and now I'm afraid to post it anymore.

Capitulation
Capitulation in finance describes the dramatic surge of selling pressure in a declining market or security that marks a mass surrender by investors. The resulting dramatic drop in market prices can mark the end of a decline, since those who didn't sell during a panic are unlikely to do so soon after.

Cracks in subprime auto, fears of repo revival aren't yet drying up Wall Street financing
Soaring used-car prices have kept a key spigot of funding for the record $1.6 trillion subprime auto loan market open, even as cracks in consumer credit have begun to emerge. Wall Street bond deals that bundle up used-car loans to borrowers with spotty credit have been rolling along despite fears of a new wave of auto repossessions as high inflation hits households least able to afford it.

$AMZN Forecasting an earnings beat quite significantly. Disclaimer: Neither a bull or a bear 
 
Street Estimated EPS: 0.13 
Forecasted EPS: 0.38 
 
Got information from a private logistic company, working as the middleman for the middleman (i.e., UPS) that Amazon did approximately 21% less in sales from 2Q21 vs 2Q22. QoQ, they said that Amazon did less sales this quarter vs. last quarter, largely due to seasonality. The summer months have been known for Amazon to perform the worst while the winter seasons, have the largest upticks. They also said that higher fuel and labor costs have increased a total of 23% across their EBITDA QoQ. However, they have said that COGS (cost of goods sold) increased by 14%.  
 
There's a lot of other assumptions I took into account, but due to the lack of space, I have provided the main metrics that account for EPS at a high level.  
 
Bottom line is, wall street expecting 0.13 EPS is downright a huge underestimation to the company and will be a huge beat

$WMT Down 10% AH and $SPY is still a dollar higher than the lows of today's trading. This market is shaking everything off. It's clearly going to take a lot to take her down. $AAPL earnings and Fed are going to be the key catalysts. But Apple will probably pull a rabbit out of its hat, and the market will assume that means the economy is primed, inflation has peaked, and the market has bottomed. 
 
I still have the feeling that bad news is good news and good news is great news. Doesn't matter anymore. Market is either going sideways or up. 
 
Hopefully I'm wrong.

President Joe Biden was set to meet with industry CEOs and labor leaders to boost the U.S.'s competitiveness in the sector. 
 
Biden was set to meet with the industry virtually, the White House said on Monday to discuss the $54B CHIPS Act to boost U.S. manufacturing. 
 
The administration did not say who would be attending the meeting, but did note that U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin would attend. 
 
Last week, the U.S. Senate voted 64-34 to advance legislation that some have called Chips-plus, which would give $54B in subsidies to encourage manufacturers to build foundries in the U.S., as well as a new, four-year 25% tax credit. 
 
Following the procedural vote, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Thursday that the legislative body was "moving forward" on a bill to aid the chip industry.

$GOOG $TSLA One of the items mentioned in the Wall Street Journal story was the fact that Musk and Brin are no longer friendly towards each other. Brin previously provided $500,000 to Tesla when it faced financial hurdles in 2008. Musk was a regular guest at Brin‚Äôs house in Silicon Valley.

The report said Brin had asked his advisors to sell his stakes in any Musk related companies. This is good stuff Bearish
