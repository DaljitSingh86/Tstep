Mortgage demand drops to a 22-year low as higher interest rates and inflation crush homebuyers
Industry News
Surging inflation and interest rates are hammering American consumers and weighing on the housing market.

Mortgage demand fell last week, hitting the lowest point since 2000, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.

Buyers have lost considerable purchasing power as rates have almost doubled since earlier this year.

The pain in the mortgage market is only getting worse as higher interest rates and inflation hammer American consumers.

Mortgage demand fell more than 6% last week compared with the previous week, hitting the lowest level since 2000, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s seasonally adjusted index.

Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home dropped 7% for the week and were 19% lower than the same week in 2021. Buyers have been contending with high prices all year, but with rates almost double what they were in January, they’ve lost considerable purchasing power.

“Purchase activity declined for both conventional and government loans as the weakening economic outlook, high inflation and persistent affordability challenges are impacting buyer demand,” said Joel Kan, an economist for the MBA.

While buyers are less affected by weekly moves in interest rates, the broader picture of rising rates has already taken its toll. Mortgage rates moved higher again last week after falling slightly over the past three weeks.

The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($647,200 or less) increased to 5.82% from 5.74%, with points increasing to 0.65 from 0.59 (including the origination fee) for loans with a 20% down payment. That rate was 3.11% the same week one year ago.

Tesla Converts 75% of Bitcoin Bet Back to Fiat Currency
Company News
Tesla seems to be abandoning its ten-figure bitcoin bet amid a severe slump in cryptocurrency markets.

The electric-car maker said on Wednesday that it has sold approximately 75% of its bitcoin as of June 30. It said it converted $936 million worth of the cryptocurrency into fiat between April and June.

Tesla made waves — and sent the price of bitcoin skyrocketing — when it announced a $1.5 billion investment in the cryptocurrency in February 2021. A company of Tesla's stature placing such a big bet on the burgeoning and volatile crypto market was unprecedented. Tesla held onto much of its stake as bitcoin soared to new heights by the end of 2021.

But the value of bitcoin has plummeted since amid a wider economic downturn. The currency has lost more than 50% of its value this year and took another sharp dive on Wednesday afternoon following Tesla's announcement.

Elon Musk's automaker said it still holds $218 million worth of the digital currency. It justified its initial purchase by saying that it was looking into liquid assets that had more upside than cash.

Tesla said it made $272 million on bitcoin sales early last year. Add that to the $936 million it offloaded this quarter and the $218 million it still held at the end of the quarter, and Tesla comes out roughly $74 million in the red on its bitcoin bet.

Tesla reported second-quarter earnings on Wednesday, beating analyst estimates but logging its first ever quarter-over-quarter decline in profit. A coronavirus lockdown in Shanghai severely limited Tesla's ability to produce vehicles at its factory there, cutting its overall sales for the quarter

Tesla Reports Q2 Earnings
Company News
Earnings per share (EPS): $2.27 (adjusted) vs $1.81 expected, according to Refinitiv

Revenue: $16.93 billion, vs. $17.1 billion expected, according to Refinitiv

Early this month, Tesla reported vehicle deliveries of 254,695 electric cars for the period ending June 30, 2022, showing 27% growth from the year-ago quarter, but an 18% decrease sequentially. Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales Tesla discloses. Its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles comprised 93% of those deliveries.

Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine and Covid outbreaks in China exacerbated ongoing semiconductor and parts shortages, along with other supply chain snags. Covid restrictions in Shanghai forced Tesla to temporarily suspend or limit production at its factory there during the second quarter of 2022.

CEO Elon Musk also lamented the high costs of starting up production at new factories in Austin, Texas and Grünheide in Brandenburg, Germany. During an interview with Tesla Owners Silicon Valley, a company-recognized fan club, Musk said the two new factories “are gigantic money furnaces.”

The CEO announced steep headcount cuts in June.

Tesla’s cryptocurrency holdings also likely declined in value substantially, depending on how the company traded them. Barclay’s analyst Brian Johnson said on Monday that he expects Tesla to record an impairment of up to roughly $460 million due to bitcoin declines.

On the brighter side, Tesla recently marked a milestone with an employee posting on LinkedIn this week that the company surpassed production of 2 million vehicles at its Fremont, California factory.

According to a White House memo from June 28, Tesla also plans to “begin production of new Supercharger equipment that will enable non-Tesla EV drivers in North America to use Tesla Superchargers.”

U.S. Senate votes to move ahead on chip bill to compete with China
The U.S. Senate on Tuesday voted to move ahead with a slimmed-down version of legislation to provide billions of dollars in subsidies and tax credits for the semiconductor industry, hoping to ease a shortage that has disrupted production in industries from automobiles to electronics and high-tech weapons.

The Senate backed by 64 to 34 a procedural measure setting the stage for potential votes to pass the legislation in the Senate and House of Representatives by the end of next week.

The bill is part of a broad effort across the government to push back against a rising China and ease supply-chain problems, in this case by decreasing U.S. companies' reliance on foreign-made semiconductors.

The final text was not released before the procedural vote, but Senate aides said the measure includes about $54 billion in subsidies for U.S. semiconductor companies, as well as a new, four-year 25% tax credit to encourage companies to build plants in the United States. The tax credit is estimated to be worth about $24 billion.

Officials from President Joe Biden's administration had urged Congress to pass a semiconductor bill before leaving Washington for their annual August recess, saying it would not only create and preserve U.S. jobs, but also bolster national security.

Pelosi's husband buying over $1 million of computer chip stock ahead of vote
Full Article

Paul Pelosi, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband, made a stock purchase of over $1 million in a computer chip company just weeks before a potential vote in Congress which would give a massive subsidy to the industry.

Mr. Pelosi made a purchase of between $1 million and $5 million shares of Nvidia, a semiconductor company, according to a disclosure filing made by Speaker Pelosi's office. He exercised 200 call options, or 20,000 shares, the disclosure states. The disclosure raised eyebrows, as Reuters reported that the Senate could vote on a bill that contains billions of dollars in subsidies within the semiconductor industry as early as Tuesday. 

Curtis Houck, managing editor of right-leaning media watchdog NewsBusters, said it was "no accident that the liberal media have made the decision to ignore" the story that could damage Pelosi. 

"For those that are aware of it, they have zero comprehension and/or shame to realize how it's a quintessential story of how the elites work for their own financial benefit, not that of the American people," Houck told Fox News Digital. 

Meanwhile, Nancy Pelosi's office has attempted to distance the House Speaker from her husband’s recent stock trades. 

"The Speaker does not own any stocks. As you can see from the required disclosures, with which the Speaker fully cooperates, these transactions are marked ‘SP’ for Spouse. The Speaker has no prior knowledge or subsequent involvement in any transactions," spokesman Drew Hammill told FOX Business. 

In 2020, Republican Sen. Richard Burr, N.C., and other high-profile lawmakers came under fire for stock sales in the run-up to the COVID-19 pandemic that were suspected to have been made based on confidential information about the pending outbreak. CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS and NBC all covered the story. "The Rachel Maddow Show" even featured a lengthy commentary about it. 

Charlie Gasparino appeared on "Tucker Carlson Tonight" on Monday to discuss whether the move could be insider trading. 

"This dude is a rising star on Wall Street," Gasparino joked before taking a serious tone.

Who should you believe?
2 news stories this morning with contradictory headlines

CNBC - "S&P 500 triggers signal with perfect track record for calling end of bear markets"
Seeking Alpha - "The current rally will likely fail, expect S&P 500 to drop below June lows"

The only thing we can all agree on, the market will move.... or it'll be flat.

Home prices are still going up a lot in many area despite the recent rate increases (with proof)
Here is a house in Boston, Massachusetts which was sold on July 8, 2022 for $875,000. Then today July 20, 2022 (within 2 weeks), the house is back on the market for $950,000 - for $75,000 or 8.57% price increase. There was about 3 months from pending/under agreement until the final sell date but still it's a crazy jump without any renovation done on the house... .

My thesis on Ally Financial has changed with their earnings for the short term, and increased defaults and charge offs as a longer term problem. I'm still bullish on them long term for their strong presence in the auto loan sector but I think the short and mid term headwinds give me time focus on buying them later. I'm thinking of rotating that money into C, which is a higher conviction play. I'm up a tiny bit on Ally, it would at worst be a break even, as I bought them over the last month. Thoughts?

Ally is a long hold for me

Their buybacks and dividend are great, assuming they keep happening.

There is a giant misunderstanding in the FP mortgage thread about OER and housing costs.

First it massively understates the increase in housing costs due to self-reporting biases. The second is that when housing prices go up, YES shelter costs go up too. I got massively downvoted but explain it here:

https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/w3lo3s/mortgage_demand_drops_to_a_22year_low_as_higher/igxllat/

The main idea is that your home is basically an asset just like anything else. Living in it just makes yourself the landlord. If you lived somewhere cheaper and rented your place out for far higher, then your shelter cost would go way down. In essence living in your home is still a cost.

Housing costs are a thing yes. Everyone understands that you have to pay rent or a mortgage. But when you add up your assets you shouldn't count your home since you are using it

First off, it's still an asset and considered part of your networth. But I think you are misunderstanding my point, that is not the discussion here.

I am saying that whether you own or rent, you still incur housing costs. This is the key thing that people are missing. If I have $1M and apartment yields are only 2% but I expect stocks to achieve 10% CAGR over the next decade, I might rationally rent and put it into stocks instead.

If you agree on that point, we are in agreement.

I am saying the BLS correctly treats homes as an asset but also something that incurs shelter cost at the same time due to the fact that you could be renting it or renting from someone else instead.

https://bhrentersalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/BLS-on-Rent.pdf

Housing units are not in the CPI market basket. Like most other economic series, the CPI views housing units as capital (or investment) goods and not as consumption items. Spending to purchase and improve houses and other housing units is investment and not consumption. Shelter, the service the housing units provide, is the relevant consumption item for the CPI. The cost of shelter for renteroccupied housing is rent. For an owner-occupied unit, the cost of shelter is the implicit rent that owner occupants would have to pay if they were renting their homes.

The renter pays rent. The property owner pays a mortgage. If they don't have a mortgage then there's an opportunity cost of putting part of the equity to work

The opportunity cost is what you could make if you instead didn't buy a home and invested your down payment instead.

Alternatively, it is the cost of you renting out your property that is mortgaged and living with your parents. That is your shelter cost.

Not sure if you saw the part I added. It can also be thought of if you rent out your whole apartment or home and lived with your parents. That is your shelter cost according to the BLS and that is correct.

You have to live somewhere.

Sure you can rent your place and downgrade/live in your parents basement. But most don't want to do that

Here is a simple way to understand the same concept very clearly.

Say a $1M apartment you own in a big city has 3% yield of rent or $30k a year. Your neighbor is renting the exact same apartment layout with identical facing view also at $30k. If you decide to sell your apartment for $1M and invest in 5% bonds to pocket the difference and pay rent instead to him, is shelter all of a sudden a cost but before it wasn't?

Better yet if you sell and invest in 3% bonds and make no profit, is shelter still not a cost?

You do realize that rents factor in things like mortgage, taxes, maintenance, some utilities, ect, ect. Basically, the landlord needs to be able to make a profit. They aren't renting to you out of the goodness of your heart and barely breaking even.

So you will be paying more in rent than what you were paying in your mortgage/taxes/ect

If I have a $1M in cash and my home has a meager yield of 2% (you claim to be an area with peanut rents so let's look at that). But I expect the market to yield 10% CAGR over ten years.

It might be rational to put it into the market instead rather than buy a home. Per the BLS you must separate out ownership / investment with consumption of housing as a good.

Housing units are not in the CPI market basket. Like most other economic series, the CPI views housing units as capital (or investment) goods and not as consumption items. Spending to purchase and improve houses and other housing units is investment and not consumption. Shelter, the service the housing units provide, is the relevant consumption item for the CPI.

For an owner-occupied unit, the cost of shelter is the implicit rent that owner occupants would have to pay if they were renting their homes.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing "ect" instead of "etc."

"Ect" is a common misspelling of "etc," an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase "et cetera." Other abbreviated forms are etc., &c., &c, and et cet. The Latin translates as "et" to "and" + "cetera" to "the rest;" a literal translation to "and the rest" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

Right just like every renter has to live somewhere right? But they still choose whether to pay more or less rent depending on their needs. In theory if a family were stretched enough by rental costs they might go from a 3 BR to 2BR and squeeze two kids into a single bedroom for example.

Similarly the fact that you own the place doesn't change the fact that you "chose" to live there and hence pay yourself rent instead of renting it out and going cheaper. You are simultaneously tenant and landlord. Every year that you continue to live in an expensive home, is a year you decide to live in an expensive place that could otherwise generate income.

It is a logical fallacy to ignore opportunity cost and say you don't have shelter costs because you own it.

It might depend on the location.

Where I am, rentals aren't really cheaper than a mortgage. Whole homes rent for 3k+, where a mortgage will be less than that even accounting for taxes. For a 1 bedroom, Good luck finding something decent for less than $1500, and a 1 bedroom isn't feasible for families anyway, only single people and couples.

So yeah, I could rent my home for 3k and downgrade to a shitty 1 bedroom. But why would I do that and be miserable? All for a measley $400 a month after the mortgage, having to deal with tenants, repairs, taxes on my small profits, vacancy rates.

It's not worth it, and not as clear cut/simple as you make it out to be. In the end what I'd get is literal peanuts and be in a worse housing situation.

My point is not to say it is easy or not. Frictional costs are real too.

My point is that clearly and rationally measuring shelter costs must treat your home as an asset and opportunity cost must be accounted for.

The 'opportunity' I lose is via the down payment and closing costs. Instead of investing in stocks/whatever, I invested in a home.

Ie - my money is tied up in a house instead of the stock market. But homes appreciate in value as well, it's just part of my 'portfolio'.

Say your neighbor rents you their house which is otherwise identical to your current one. You sell yours and invest in a REIT which is expected to perform as well as your home or even better.

Do you consider your living situation an expense?

Fwiw I understand the point you make.

My point is while you can maybe make a little money renting your home, but that too comes with a cost. And in the end for my area at least it just isn't worth it.

It's possible you are way underestimating what you will get in rent. OER actually systematically understates for this very reason. Homeowners tend to accurately value their home as an investment but are very off on its rental and consumption value.

If indeed rental costs were that low you could make a killing by renting. And in fact there are definitely periods in history where renting to put it in the stock market would actually have paid off very well.

And the funny thing is only about $430 of my $1050 goes to the mortgage and interest.

The rest is property taxes, insurance and the HOA (~$300)

Paying off the mortgage makes the math work in my favor. But...then I'm out on a large chunk of cash that could be invested elsewhere. I'll pass.

Not really. Units in my complex go for $1700 (condos) in rent. My monthly obligation is about $1050 all said and done. Sounds great, right? That's a $650 a month in my pocket.

But not really. It's going to sit empty some of the time, 5% on average.

Then there's taxes. Let's just say 20% of my whole earnings are taxed because I'm to lazy to deal with the brackets. That's down to ~$500 a month. Woohoo! Dca that into VOO for about 6k pet year.

Meantime, I'll rent an equivalent unit for $1700 since..that's what they go for in my complex.

But..wait. My monthly obligation went to $1700 from $1050.

I'm actually losing money.

Yes.

Just as a mortgage/taxes are a monthly expense. The difference is with the mortgage you build some equity every month. Rent, you don't.

You are right in that you can take the 100k down and closing costs and invest in other areas and rent instead. Some people are fine with that, and it certainly is an option. Maybe the 100k does better in 30 years than a home you could have bought with it. Maybe not.

Exactly. You must treat it as an asset. That is how the BLS treats it as per my link.

That is the entire rationale for using OER in the first place instead of excluding it. The problem is not that the logic for why homeowners have a shelter cost being wrong, it is that the methodology for measuring it is flawed due to self-reporting. But they correctly recognize shelter is an expense.

It's possible my area is different. But it's unlikely that yields are that low in your area and it be sustainable.

It can't be worse than treasuries right? If it's 1%-2% you might seriously consider investment grade bonds that pay 6%+ over time as a form of arbitrage.

Discover Financial beats on top and bottom lines, sees strong loan and network volume growth, buys back 5.8M shares, and..is down 3.6% in aftermarket because they suspended buybacks due to an internal student loan investigation.

Disappointing given that their squeaky clean/customer friendly image is much of the appeal, but also means they go from strongly to absurdly FCF positive while that investigation goes on and suspended buybacks do show management isn't reckless.

I'll be looking to buy more if there's a big dip on the news.

So NFLX inflates negative guidance to 2m subscriber loss so 970k subscribers seems like a win and TSLA sells bitcoin to hide negative cash flow.

This is the ER equivalent of margins and line spacing on an essay to hit the page requirement.

They actually lost 2m subscribers in the market they make the most money on US & Europe. Which to me sounds awful. They gained close to 1m subs in Asia so they ended up with close to 1m net loss of subs.

I've been slowly building up my XOM position on dips. If there isn't an impending severe recession, I am very excited about XOM's performance the next few quarters. Especially after today's news where the Saudis admit they won't exceed the 13 million per day mark (which they hope to hit in 2027).

I otherwise am avoiding any kind of commodity plays.

Anyone in a taxable brokerage account that is down in index funds should read up on tax loss harvesting. Down markets are a great way to lock in losses which can even be carried over to the future years if its beyond the $3k limit. Can't be the same/equivalent fund. Switching between something like VOO and VTI could be useful.

Yes, but they both are S&P500 funds. There is a chance its flagged as "substantially identical" and be viewed as a wash sale. VTI and VOO has very similar performance historically as the weighted companies are both the same. VTI adds exposure to small caps but its such a small amount percentage wise thats its insignificant compared to the core S&P500 companies.

I don’t think anybody has ever been flagged for a wash sale between VOO and SPY. Everything I have ever read on it say the minute difference between holding structure and management fees are regarded as enough to differentiate them.

According to Investopedia, who cited an IRS publication, SPY and VOO are not substantially identical although they acknowledge that could change in the future.

If I buy 100 shares of stock A at $25/share with the hopes of eventually selling those 100 shares at $35/share, what are the downsides of just continually selling covered calls with a strike price of $35?

It seems like I would be able to just keep collecting premiums until I sell the shares at $35, which was the exit target to begin with.

Obviously the share price can go down and I could have unrealized losses on the initial investment, but am I missing something else here, or can you just keep collecting premiums on the CCs until reaching your target exit price with no downside?

Depends on your timeframe, but on most stocks you won't be able to collect hardly any premium when you're selling that far OTM, so you're going to have to drastically adjust goals or timeframes to make it "worth" it.

For example, BAC (large cap, low price, and IV is low which are all factors) is currently at $33.36 and a 9/16/22 $38 call is selling for $0.21, meaning you collect an additional $21 for waiting 2 months. The other issue is that the premium on the call is going to accelerate as price increases, so if you sold the call today for $0.21 and BAC went to $38.36 overnight, that call is now worth $1.85. So you really only make $3.36/share instead of the full $5 since there's still $1.50 in theta/extrinsic value now left in that option til it expires.

The only real risk is that the spot price falls enough to where you're no longer able to sell premiums at a price above your cost basis, meaning you're potentially going to sell at a loss if you sell calls and get assigned.

That said, it's no additional risk to just owning shares outright, you just run the "risk" of potentially giving up gains (potentially a lot of them at higher timeframes) and you have to decide if that's worth it.

That's the idea. Collect some juicy (or not) premiums as you wait for the stock to climb to your exit point. That's the ideal time to sell them imo.

And there would be no other downsides other than the risk of the unrealized losses in the event that the stock price goes under the initial purchase price ($25 in the above example)?

Not really, unless you change your mind about selling right after you hit/exceed the strike price. Worst thing that can happen with a CC is having to sell the shares, so if you are already ok with selling the shares, it's basically free money for as long as your stock stays below strike.

My completely uneducated guess is the latter. I think Ford is moving towards being all in on EVs and this is still an early stage move. Ford is one of my top holdings and I like this move a lot. However, I do hate to see people lose their jobs.

This and also /u/redlux03 you shouldn't really put too much stock into after hours market. The volume is generally pretty low and things will move a lot different than once the market opens up.

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/afterhourstrading.asp

Participation

If liquidity and prices weren’t enough of a reason to make after-hours trading risky, the lack of participants makes it even riskier. In some cases, certain investors or institutions may choose simply not to participate in after-hours trading, regardless of the news or the event.

This means that it is quite possible for a stock to fall sharply in the after-hours only to rise once the regular trading session resumes the next day at 9:30 a.m., should many big institutional investors have a different view of the price action during the after-hours trading session.

Because volume is thin and spreads are wide in after-hours trading it is much easier to push prices higher or lower, requiring fewer shares to make a substantial impact. Since after-hours trading can have a significant impact on a stock's price, it's not a bad idea to put a limit order on any shares you intend to buy or sell outside of regular trading periods.

Well now it's 2 hours later but they actually addressed it specifically on the call. They said they were worried about liquidity due to difficulties in china and freed up some cash. It does distort the numbers but nothing nefarious.

Trying to get some light on this, I think I will have to wait the 30days to not trigger a wash sale,

I sold some stock today, to cash out and pay off the rest of my car loan. It would probably be paid off on Monday, how long do I have to wait to start buying back the stock I sold today? will it be 30days so its not a wash sale, regardless of some of it was at a loss?

the Fidelity app chat person just said I could buy it back today if I was "day trading" but I am not. just sold a little to finish paying off this loan.

Thanks.

If you buy again on Monday what you sold at a loss then you will trigger a wash sale indeed.

Is this a stock or an etf?

Busy day. I sold $INTC and bought more $MO, $MOS, $KMI and $T. Kinder Morgan reports after the bell. AT&T before market open. The wise man would have waited until after earnings.

If it does leg down it’s impossible to say. A lot of wealthy people seem to have bought in recently on the last dip. But anything could happen

I may be wrong, but I have a feeling some of the FOMO that turned into buying today is going to hurt again soon.

I’m not ultra bear, but I don’t think things will just rip up from here. I hope for significant recovery before end of year but this seems a bit too quick and sudden.

I myself this week have picked up VTI and BRK. But the reactions to less than stellar earnings reports because they have a heads up they wouldn’t be good seems off.

I’m going to keep DCA into VTI with my cash, wait till after earnings to potentially add to MFST, ISRG, And APPL.

Who knows though 🤷🏻‍♂️

I did! And not denying the market moved like I have never seen it.

But I couldn’t make sense of it then, and it doesn’t mean it didn’t happen. What we saw was unprecedented. I can’t make sense of it ripping up from here either, doesn’t mean it won’t.

Again I’m no ultra bear but I would rather miss a couple points here and there to DCA rather than predict the bottom. I’m telling you I don’t know, and honestly anybody that says they do probably also has a beach house they can sell you in Colorado!

why do meme stocks get dragged up on days like this? PTON up 15 percent? it can't just be normal investors with positive sentiment who have diversified portfolios. who exactly is piling into that company today? is it institutions just messing around with retail?

These companies have zero net income and have huge amounts of debt and people are saying risk on in a rising rate environment. These will probably sell after they see huge earnings misses and a potentially more Hawkish Fed in the future.

I would think for companies like that it is at least partly shorts covering. Fidelity says 12% of PTON is short for instance. It could also just be momentum trades seeing risk on and hitting beat down companies up for the swing

+13.5% net swing from July 14 to today overall for me, pretty wild for so few trading days, I have a pretty heavy weighting of higher quality megacaps that usually slows down my moves.

as much as the market has been moving, it's a safe bet that there are some swing traders who have either made a lot of money today, or lost a lot of money today.

Yeah I made good $200 off of tsla today. Normally I like the volatility but this is too much, WAYYYY too much uncertainty with my entrance prices(everything is like 5-10% above them).

Sitting on cash waiting for tsla earnings to make any moves

Fabs are gonna buy the equipment for their 5 year expansion whether it's subsidized or not, so personally don't see it improving on ASML's already impressive projections for sales (they need to expand factory capacity to meet the surplus demand to do that). CHIPS Act just means Intel probably won't need to cut their div while they spend all that capex.

Intel just does not want to commit to breaking thru it's resistance level of $40.24 which is 50 DMA on 3 month charts.

Edit- I just sold my $INTC position for a minor 8.5% gain for holding for a week. I'll move that cash over to $MO. I'll look at Intel again after earnings.

I've made a lot with MO, but I don't know if I would put more money in them. I guess if I had I would consider that, but I'm certainly not going to sell something to buy more.

Kinder Morgan is oil & natural gas pipelines. More natural gas than oil. They pay roughly half their profits in dividends. This quarter they reported 27 cents profit after committing to paying out 27 cents in dividends. Mosaic is a pure speculation play in AG phosphate fertilizers. I like to keep my port 80% dividend stocks and 20% speculation. Mosaic along with Cleveland-Cliffs are a huge portion of my speculation percentage.

I think a bigger effect could be the revamping of Dc if they are able to get their stuff together and get the Kevin feige type person to run it all could be huge for them. Also could be interesting if they expand their international theme parks like the one they have in Australia

Paycheck is coming in soon, so starting to drip feed my buys in. Today I bought another share each of SBUX (cost basis now 85) and AVDV (ex-US developed small cap value), and put the rest in VTI.

Other than more VTI/VXUS/AVUV/AVDV, the impulsive part of me wants to open up a position in either GOOG or TROW. But I already hold too many positions. So I shall remain restrained.

Planning to cut INTC once it reaches my cost basis (49), and put into SMH instead. Same with WMT, I'll put that into indices. WMT is a company I actually bought at good points and had sold some higher this year; I'm actually in the green.

I'm in a weird position where I'm actually least down in most of my individual stocks and most down in my indices currently.

What are the odds of Tesla fucking the entire market up, as in causing a dump tonight, from a scale of 1 to 10 where 10 is most likely?

Tesla bought Bitcoin for $1.5B earlier this year for a price of $33000 per BTC. Gonna be interesting how that will impact their financials

Well sounds like the their ER wasn't too bad:

EPS of $2.27 beating expectations of $1.83

Rev of $16.9B in line with expectations

https://twitter.com/StockMKTNewz/status/1549847877568036867



It's currently up 2% after hours. Still curious to hear what guidance looks like.
