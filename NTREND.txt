TODAY IN HISTORY, via @Investopedia  
July 24, 1970 
  
On this day in 1970, Congress approved the creation of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, more commonly known as Freddie Mac. This government-sponsored enterprise was formed to keep money flowing to mortgage lenders in support of homeownership and rental housing for middle-income Americans. However, almost 38 years later, Freddie Mac became one of the central characters in the 2008 financial crisis. Critics argued unchecked growth and risks from mortgage lenders at the time helped create conditions that caused The Great Recession.

$VTGN  4 yr chart. Every time it falls drastically, it rises drastically. Might take time, but always happens. Fell 85% on Fri and they have no available shares to do an offering. Only 1 day under $1 and they won't get a Minimum Bid Price Deficiency notice for at least 30 days and then they will have 6-12 months to get above $1, so reverse split is not an immediate threat. VTGN is 73% institutionally owned, 26% retail owned and less than 1% insider owned. Unless institutions dump all their shares for good, they will likely average down sooner or later. VistaGen has more studies in the pipeline, with results due later this year. Based on all the givens, we are less than 10-100 days away from recovery of 5%-500%. Bullish

@dep4457 sigh are you always so negative? I thought I helped you out as a nice gesture by I replying to you loads of data and all you reply to that I make mistakes with a stoplossü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Look up my profile I‚Äôm not a noob! I know how to place my stoplosses and my stoplosses are not the once the average trader is using, I stick to my Wyckoff approach and think in trading ranges rather than just basic support  and resistance levels like noobs do. BUt I don‚Äôt have a stoploss for SNAP as I already replied to you that I made 106% gains while trading and compounding the TRADING RANGE. Even if it goes to your 8 then still that‚Äôs with my avg 10.22 just -22% and so 106-22 = +84% gains still! Hence I replied I don‚Äôt care about your concerns regarding SNAP and I will make money easy here once again coming weeks. Here another example: CHWY analysts lowered price targets and people posted single digits coming while I scaled in per my Wyckoff chart  2 months later: +83%üí∞

@RainyDayFund2021 I imagine it will look something like this. At first being opened to private investment by the big players in energy, tech, biotech, etc. Then when the idea is mature enough the goal is to float NEOM on the world public markets. My guess based on what we are seeing with trademarks, it will be floated as a holding company with an ownership stake in the companies that operate within NEOM. If they do use this ticker, which my speculation and research indicate is a (strong imo) possibility, the only question left is what they do with the share structure and what happens to all the current holders‚Ä¶ Time will tell‚Ä¶ (btw I like the ad that popped up - ‚Äúprivate travel reimagined‚Äù ‚Ä¶ üòÑ) Bullish

@TradeBullBear @BatKid The more the CDDs (Cooling Degree Days) the hotter it will be, and vice versa.
With HDD's (Heating Degree Days) it works just the opposite. The more HDDs, the colder it is. 
The DDs in this chart are derived from the entirety of the US's 5 major regions. It is a national (CONUS) average.
This is the latest ECMWF Ensemble, which is a European model. 
Looks like it hasn't changed much since yesterday. CDD's  look like they will recover to current levels in about 8-10 days, but will cool off for the rest of July. Not too terribly much tho! That green line is the 5 year average.

U see $POSH & $REAL ? $VERB has 1 retailer that is like both those sites on Market

It's called MyGemma, so 1 of Verb's retail stores is equivelant to 1bn in mkt cap as Real is like 300mm, & Posh is a billion or lil less

If Verb starts putting all SharkTank retailers on the site wow.

I can 1000% see Mark Cuban taking a piece of Verb's Marketlive. This is a test to see if he wants it. Lori is good friends w/ kate from Qvc. If lori signs up as a host u can see Marketlive getting references on Sharktank that Qvc used to get.

People will put it together as soon as Lori is mentioned as a host if she does sign w/market. There is no doubt in my mind that's how Mark got introduced to Marketlive, thru lori, who was thru Kate. As i said before I wouldnt doubt all the Sharks coming on Market, & buying a piece.  That would send Verb to 20 bucks fast. Atleast 10-15 in the short run. 20-30 by eoy.
Cross your fingers man bc this might be bigger than we thought

I remember the negative posts in CHWY when I scaled in only to be in gains now of +85% üëÄ Another prime example to stick to or learn and understand advanced Wyckoff and Elliott and you don‚Äôt need any news, analyst price targets, or macro nonsense. Just make money. I remember back then the CHWY thread got flooded by noobs posting it will go down to single digits back then. While in the meantime I argued with my chart to scale in.

$NSAV since this cowardly excuse for a grown adult blocked me, can someone ask who tf these made up people are that "doesn't own any shares"? What kind of delusional nonsense is this? Who are you even talking about? Why did you quote it like that??? Pretty much every single poster here that is a "bear" openly states that they are holding and are way down from their average. Honestly some of the most low IQ/delusional/dishonest people on earth can be found right here in the NSAV "space". Lol "still holding"? Bag holding yes. We know.  
 
Interesting side note: hasn't posted for a while because the SP has been trash for so long. Goes green a few days, magically comes back to post. Isn't it always the pumpers in here who accuse "bears" of never showing up unless it's a red day??? Projection at its finest

Seems like a fair trade off.

This is a fund manager in Israel.  Says this can continue until registration statement becomes effective...first he says days (rarely for small startups) and then says it can take much longer if SEC has questions or acts slowly (most of the time). 
 
Also he does not mention the warrants which is one way that shorts can protect themselves.

We have the most important companies presenting this week, it could be the perfect excuse to push the S&P to 4176 4196 area before the real drop, that will cause more bear pain and will trap more bulls.
If you check the weekly Vix chart you will see what I mean.
It just touched the 1st upper trendline channel.
Opened gap from 22.70 to 21.15
200EMA at 21.52
400EMA at 19.96
Minimum expect to tagged the 200EMA closing the 21.15 gap.

$TBLT To explain current share price of $8 dollars √∑ 4,500, you'll get a retaining value of 0.18% (*more or less).

$TBLT has yielded a net loss of -99.82% for long investors.

To clarify the effects of 2 r/s and not retaining value.

I hope that explains to new traders, it was never a 100 or 1000 dollar strock.

Its simply been shorted to oblivion, literally.

For these reasons, I'm day trading this play or cautiously swing trading.

Nothing here is based on sales or products or projections (*please stop with that pumping).

Let's keep a level head here, make our money and set our SL.

This is an algo-squeeze play 

No idea, how long this rally will last, but I'm glad people made money here last week and ideally continue to do so in the near term.

$PLTR now for the palantir chart.  Just keeping it simple.  As you can see the volume on the oscillator is starting to trend downwards while price action is trending upwards.  Could be the first sign if a diversion but this current uptrend support is down right around $9.  That's also where the 50 SMA on The daily is curling up so that will be your range if it drops.  If this starts to beast tomorrow and Tuesday and starts making a new high it will easily hit that green 200 SMA line.  $9.75 is that black Priceline and is a really good indication of the support on the weekly chart.  If that breaks down easily I think you'll see $9.  It goes up if the market goes up and it goes down and hit support if the market goes.  In a bear market and with palantir in the growth state they are it will be very volatile until they hit profitability.  Let's hope that's in August.

Hi Robert
We just got to the 1st upper trendline channel on the weekly closing below the (100EMA $23.07)
Next target is the 200EMA $21.52 and if it doesn't  hold it will be the 400EMA next $19.96 as the worst case.
We are not on Vix extremes yet, it has a weekly gap opened from 22.70 to 21.26 too.
Last time we went under the 200EMA and wicked fast even below the 400MA.
If that's the case the S&P will go minimum to 4177 with a chance of tagging the Daily 200EMA at 4196.76 from Friday's  close.

@BarkerProdigy @Sams1967 there is no new record date! Here from the S1 that was released on July 15, 2022. ‚ÄúMeta declared a dividend, on a one-for-one basis, of shares of Series A Non- Voting Preferred Stock of Meta (the ‚ÄúSeries A Preferred Stock") to holders of record of Torchlight's common stock as of June 24, 2021. The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive certain dividends based on the net proceeds of the sale of any assets that are used or held for use in a spin-off entity to which Meta will transfer any remaining assets of such business.

You‚Äôre blocked for being shills and obviously pumping a short hedge fund ticker on gray market. The facts are set in stone about this. I guess you have a few weeks left of hopium before losing everything have fun. I know who gets the facts out and who doesn‚Äôt listen. You are mentally insane here. Here is the record date in the S1 maybe you should read it for once. That will be a revelation if you do read it. Good lucküòÇ Bullish

Backing out a little bit more on the NASDAQ chart so my original post makes a little bit more sense.  Backing all the way out to the daily you can see a little bit of a rising wedge on the stochastic and that awesome oscillator shows very little volume while 308 on Friday was actually much lower than the previous peak.  You're starting to enter a possible horrible week of news with the confirmation of a recession while it's making a lower high at the top of a channel.   That main downtrend resistance of the entire year is all the way up to 325ish.  It would need good news to push it that high tomorrow unless it gets pumped to that range from algo purchasing.  It's definitely a scenario but I would go short in this moment every time with that black price line be your shortstop.  Whatever happens it will be a wild ride this week. Get your üçø

$HOFV This is going to be an exciting week. Sooner or later you realize that a great company will chug along to all time highs and beyond regardless of economic conditions. People will always watch football, people will always eat, people will always go out to have fun, people will always bet online and onsite and people will always spend money to feel good and people love to see other have fun and the happier a destination is the more they spend because it makes them genuinely happy. So HODL and Accumulate! Bullish

$QQQ here's an updated all time chart. 

When I say "I am long term bearish" (I am, kinda), it doesn't have to always mean a 'continuous crash'. Imo, that's what newbie bears are programmed to believe - that the market is going to 'keep dropping' over time. 

Like a penny stock. Lol. 

I am expecting a long-term SIDEWAYS instead, between the 250s and somewhere close to all-time highsüôÇ

And hopefully someday in the future, or sooner, it breaks out of that ascending triangleüëçüèº

Do men and women think about climate change differently? 
 
Findings: First, they found that people surveyed in poorer countries rated climate change as a more serious problem than those in wealthier countries. They were also more likely to respond that they expect to be personally affected by a changing climate.  
 
Second, most people, of any gender, recognize that climate change is a threat. But in more wealthy countries men were more likely than women to answer that they were not concerned about it. 
 
They argue the gap in wealthy countries persisted among men and women regardless of their level of education, household income or political views‚Äîso these characteristics alone do not explain the difference.

In many ways, $UVXY and SPY are inversely related but it's not a 100% correlation.  SPY looks like it had a double top on Friday and UVXY is at a double bottom on Friday.  So the trend confirmation should come early next week..

Russia is just minor. Europe, Japan, China combined is much bigger. Covid Lock down, Econ slow down, Euro FX, inflation, all plays an important part imo.
