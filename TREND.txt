So when this stock hits $50 a share the market cap will still only be approximately a mere 66 mil.  
 
Insane!   This stock has been severely underpriced.  Anything between $50 and $100 is an absolute no brainer whatsoever! Bullish

AGRX is already compliant with Nasdaq but will fall under noncompliance again if in the next 15 days it doesn‚Äôt go over $1 we just need 1 day over $1  
 
it‚Äôs already been reverse split 40-1 and over 100% CTB

$TBLT So since TBLT started to squeeze, Today has been the best day so far. 36% the previous two days and a 39% today. You may feel like things are settling down due to the parabolic movement and consolidation but literally this did better than any day in the past week. 
 
Next week this will continue. Possible a 40%+ day on monday. Gap will fill @ $25

We need both of these to close over $1 this coming week TO TRAP SHORTS and make them cover

Shorts are banking on AGRX not going over $1 in next week  
 
AGRX is already compliant with Nasdaq but will fall under noncompliance again if in the next 15 days it doesn‚Äôt go over $1 we just need 1 day over $1  
 
it‚Äôs already been reverse split 40-1 and over 100% CTB

Lately the question has been "what's going on with crypto?" but we fail to understand that it's actually not about the imbalance but the outcome. Investing in crypto is risky at the time but I can introduce you to Ahlem Dhruv, she gives advice to traders so  we can earn passively. You can get to her on Facebook. Don't wait to Invest, Invest and wait.

$TBLT if ToughBuilt releases any type of good news next week it could really stimulate this rally, I would think that their management is working on some type of positive surprise news to release in the near future to act as a support mechanism for the current rally, to bolster it or further justify it. There is no denying the pull here, anybody trading the last few years has seen ToughBuilt stock come into focus at one time or another, and since there are No Options Trading activated yet on this stock, it has more room and breath to run next week to ATH. Seems like that short attack at the end of trading today signified that there is a serious situation developing here and much to be worried about if your on the short-side of this.

$FAZE This is one of the best articles that describes what is going on here. Not all deSPACs do this, it has to be a Perfect Storm of small available float, options and short interest. And with the final redemption #'s in today via the SEC 8K, the available float just shrank to a tiny amount. 
Get in and get out. This isn't a long term investment play, it's a squeeze play. Don't get to greedy or you will be left holding bags. As soon as an updated S1 (I think thats the form it could be another 8K form) is submitted & posted, the party will be over. 
But for right now, the squeeze is on!

$FAZE Bears on this board care so much about us longs, now they are telling us this company is sketchy.  This is why the bears always lose money on squeeze plays, they have no idea how much price goes up, then they start blaming others on why they invest in sketchy companies.  As for me, I remain firm in my bullish conviction and see $50+ incoming. Bullish

These people that use bots, scanners to alert and try to get you to join.  Oh and including others on here that want you to pay for live halt alerts....

They all post the very few that actually went in gain....

They do not post the majority of the alerts because they never amounted to anything.

Meaning that service is highly likely to not work out for you.  You would literally have to take all alerts and enter. The few that actually win will not offset the majority that lost. 

It's a word game. Advertising as an art.

$TBLT I'm in $XELA and $ENVB too and I think I've learned something from trading these three stocks. What I've learned is that it's not the intrinsic value of the company that matters. It's not even the price (buy low is relative). The most important thing is timing. It's about momentum, and other shit like that.  
 
With a cheap stock that you "believe in," you're gonna get app-happy retail traders flipping for a hundred bucks endlessly. The tutes know this and they're not gonna accumulate slowly because then they'd have to wait for it to move like the rest of us plebes. So they loan out shares to shorters in the meantime, collect those premiums, and wait for their chance to buy a fuckton all at once. 
 
Only when the little guys abandon hope, when regret has made them bitter, deformed caricatures of their former selves, can the magic happen. Profit is a transmogrification the shattered will and broken spirit of other human beings. 
 
Happy weekend! Bullish
