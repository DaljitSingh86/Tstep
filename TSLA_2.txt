 had 2 factories operating at <10% capacity & ‘burning cash,’ its main factory in Shanghai closed for half the quarter with people jumping out of buildings, not to mention inflation and supply chain issues from the war, and STILL delivered $800 million in free cash flow and $2.28 in EPS. What happens when all 4 factories are running smoothly in Q4? 500K vehicles is conceivable in Q4 if they hit the 40K/week run rate Elon mentioned with 2170 cell vehicles- more than they made in all 4 quarters of 2020.  Santa Rally this year would be awesome! Congrats to Tesla team on the best ‘bad’ quarter ever!

A quick trading tip for everyone  .....    

As I told members earlier today, I wasn't optimistic about SNAP's earnings. However, the option mkt was reading rather bullish. With 10 minutes left in trading, I sent out an alert to members (SEE BELOW) stating how the two biggest companies that are impacted by advertising spend  - GOOGL and META were very weak as we were closing out the day. That ended up being a big "tell". SNAP would fall 25% AHrs. 

My new Game Plan goes out Sunday. It's a big one because I analyze all the big earnings next week. For those yet to join, email me at jessielivermore1929@gmail.com 

Finding little nuggets like the one I sent to members today can give an advantage needed in this mkt. ✌️

 surprise surprise. Was not at all shocked to see Tesla moving up this hard, this quick. Tesla only up due to a short squeeze, per usual. It’s still midterm bearish, IMO. I’m possibly long for long term, but not until this drops to at least 300-400 first. Would love to see it at 100 range, but lol I doubt I’d ever be that lucky. Waiting for “investors” to get bored of it and panic sell. I don’t see how TESLA does well at all for next ER. 

I hope markets crash soon and I can grab more 
$AAPL
 much cheaper.. expecting they do bad for the next ER’s, themselves. 

If markets stay in this higher range, it’s going to be a very boring few years with really slow growth. So much better if people take profits and crash the markets lower for better buying opportunity. 

So far, we got FOMC and probable rate hikes again next week, 26/27th. And Apple earnings on the 28th. Combo wombo for a pure market disaster. I think this ongoing rally is suggesting that it’s no longer priced in.

 This guy is awesome with the chart analysis, he called the top of the market during COVID. He's suggesting that we may run through Tuesday but one day from now until then it's expected to top out, rollover and hit some big lows, potentially down to 3500 or it could reverse a bit above June lows. This is expected to be the final selloff into the real market recovery.

If we can get it past 900 on a 3:1 that's a $300 share price. 
 
I feel like we can get to 900 and once it's 300/share there will be a rush to buy it back up to $400 putting this where it should be

 Tesla looking really solid from a technical perspective right now. We have a breakout from a long lasting consolidation triangle, a buy-indication on both supertrend and Donchian trend ribbon (really solid confirmation). Volume was also really high on the released revenue statement. 

Could expect a minor pullback. But I would say the uptrend-ratio potential looks really solid from here on. 

Good luck fellow traders 🍀

 an honest congrats to the bulls today.  This has gone higher than I ever possibly imagined and my portfolio is sitting at a substantial theoretical loss.

I don’t buy weeklies, so I’m okay to hold my puts because I do not panic sell.

Every single time I’ve changed my initial thesis to the other side of the trade, I have lost.  This time I held on, and I am sitting on a massive theoretical loss if I were to sell.

I still believe if 
$SPY
 loses support, 
$TSLA
 will deflate, but if the .50 surprise ECB rate hike and the impending .75-1.00 FOMC hike doesn’t do it- then we have actually hit either the bottom or a substantial plateau on the way to a near bottom.

Until then, please help me Santa, please let my puts break even or just average down my loss.  FML. 😮‍💨

“We are encouraged by (FSD) pricing commentary & teaser for AI Day 2. As a standalone, we believe FSD software revenue can lift GMs by 150-200bps+, with significant upside from robotaxi,” Rusch added.

 dont try to fight the MMs. As a bear you have had a great run. Major correction to the covid market euphoria. Yet when every pundit and news outlet was pushing this we are in a recession story you had to see the setup for the bounce. Yes rates are going to impact growth but the effects are never immediate. Yes ppl buying cars and houses at crazy premiums because many working skilled middle class getting big salary jumps in this environment. Are the low income households suffering the most? Absolutely but until the new big spenders blow their wad, they will keep the economy going that companies wont have to do major layoffs. The problem of trying to time the big market crash is most usually are too soon. Are their visible cracks showing up? Absolutely but this is not a recession. More working class is better off than they were before covid. So what can trigger it? Well big mortgages and car pmts not good if lose your job. The only thing will trigger is major layoffs by companies.

I just wanted to share this to show where we might go with SNAP tomorrow.

Today we went with a Tesla call because it opened and went above the highest resistance on our pivot points (see below) which is a very good indication this would continue upward all day

Tomorrow you should watch out for SNAP because it might do the same thing as Tesla but go below its lowest resistance line which will signal a put.

You need to always respect support and resistance lines despite what you think should happen with any tickers.

Twitter deal we all got musked. Used it to sell off a ton of stock and f”@$&! still act like it was cool he did so meanwhile he yanked all other investors by the balls and it is all just a big game. The road to hell is paved in good intentions and greed.

 idiot bears (and some bulls too) read the headlines ("lower margins") and think that this will be an ongoing problem. They don't understand the logistics of a shutdown and the inefficiencies of ramping back up. Better margins are created by economies of scale. When Tesla's factories (existing and new) ramp up, you will see margins go back up (and even better than before).

Fantastic S&P500 bull market analog chart. All 3 bull markets since 1998 are overlapped here. The yellow line is the tech boom bust of 1998-2001. The blue line is the housing boom bust of 2005-2008. The white line is our current boom bust from 2019-2022. If the bottom is not in yet then A major low in Oct would be a great opportunity to buy.

Margins are going to continue to be reduced and costs escalate to the point where it's a practical matter of high margins or large scale production and distribution. That was the real lesson from the earnings, which was easy to ignore or overlook in a different monetary and globalization era. 
 
What bulls are guilty of is greatly exaggerating how many people will be Tesla customers at any point in the future. 
 
Market penetration will be weak if the cars are a hefty premium to the competition. Tesla could run all of its factories around the clock and still not produce enough cars to meet current demand - but even if it did do that it would still not be enough market share to raise profits enough to justify its valuation, and demand diminishes as the price increases so it's self-limiting.

Took a 17k loss on weekly 
$QQQ
 puts today midday after averaging down the entire week. To think if I had just kept my calls Tuesday morning I could have made 200k+$. 
This market is so stupid using logic to try and understand it is counterproductive. There was zero reason for the market to be green today, zero.

 
$TSLA
  had terrible earnings inflated by a digital asset sale and it rallied 10% today. 

In conclusion, options are the absolute devil. I hate them and I don’t know why I always go back. Was successful for a couple weeks in a row then managed to give it all back plus extra assuming the market couldn’t only go up for a week straight. Feel stupid myself for doing this all over again.

Option #1 (of many using Olive):

Make up to 7.0% (28.6% annualized)

With Next weeks monster lineup of ERs from Megas along with FOMC and GDP data, we have the perfect storm for the final, capitulatory bottom. 

Once the big boys like MSFT, GOOG and AAPL start posting bad results, along with raising interest rates and a negative GDP print, we could be looking at a 7-13% red week.

That would undoubtedly put in the bottom as well off sheer capitulation and VIX blowoff top.

The 200ma is at $343, roughly 13.9% from here, not only do I think it’s doable, but it’s coming fast.

Fuel from this dumb rally is there.

Tesla’s bad earnings yesterday was the canary in the coal mine, yet bulls ignored and the rally raged on.

Now 
$SNAP
’s horrendous earnings, missing their own guidance by 50% is nothing short of a catastrophic event.

This rally is over, but now we have to measure downside targets below previous lows.

With a negative GDP and recession confirmation next week, paired with FED once again hiking 75bp, maybe even 100, it’s time to SNAP back to reality. 

On top of this, with SNAPs huge miss, GOOG and META are more than likely to miss as well, and who’s to say the decline consumer spending won’t break the bulls last hope, 
$AAPL
?
