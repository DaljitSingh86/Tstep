Target's Results Cap Upside Potential For Retail Stocks
Target's (NYSE: TGT ) Q2 results reinforce a problem facing the retail sector that was only hinted at by Walmart ( NYSE: WMT ) and Home Depot ( NYSE: HD ) earlier in the week. The company's efforts to combat supply chain and inventory hurdles are catching up with it at the same time that demand is falling.

What Cramer is watching Wednesday - Target, Lowe's disappoint after Walmart, Home Depot deliver
What I am looking at Aug.17, 2022 Wall Street is poised to open lower Wednesday as the 2-year Treasury yield jumps to its highest level since the June 16 stock market bottom. Retail sales in July were unchanged versus up 1% expected. Excluding autos, they rose 0.4%, a much bigger increase than expected.

Meme stocks got there name because people on reddit discovered that tickers were being scanned on reddit's website and they gathered how many times each ticker was talked about. They used that info to short different stocks.

Once reddit discovered that. We switched to using memes to talk about DD so the programs couldnt read the .jpeg files

But please keep spitting out the same bullshit media talks about.

$AAPL Apple Cash on hand at June 30 2022 was $48 BIL, while debt was $94BIL. Debt keeps getting more expensive and cash levels are dropping. They raised another $6BIL of debt in Aug, so we Apple has over $100BIL of debt. No tax was paid and debt was used to buy back stock at elevated prices.  
 
If sales go down, this will be super risky stock. War in Taiwan, China could also hurt the new cash generation and they will be desperate for it. Bearish

How to start investing if the stock market scares you
The GDP dipped in July, sparking recession fears and scaring many Americans about their financial futures. That fear may even lead some to avoid investing altogether, or to panic and sell current stocks. But it shouldn't. For first-time investors who may be afraid of the current market, the "Wolfette of Wall Street" Lauren Simmons shares some advice to try: Ignore how you feel.

$BBBY If there’s one thing that we should take away from 1/21 - 29 it’s that, on a momentum play, fundamentals do not matter. GME was on its way to bankruptcy as was AMC. 

I’m not an advocate for either, but I am an advocate for making a profit… Which GME made me at 380%

If you’re scared of this one because it doesn’t make sense fundamentally, you’re missing the point, and your chance to make a large return.

$EMBK so at 8 am when ally opens for pre mkt I tried to dump my reduced reverse split shares and ally would not let me execute the commission free trade online...They said for this particular security I had to call toll free to speak to a broker to execute the trade for a $20 commission fee.....TRAPPED and having to hold this LOSER...... 
LOL........I yelled and they agreed to waive the $20 commission fee so I got out somewhere in the 14's....
