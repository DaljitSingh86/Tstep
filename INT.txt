$BBBY such strength. It’s staging it’s next move up chairman of $GME Cohen but 7-8 million shares of BBBY at ABG $17 and has $60-80 strike calls expiring in 4 months. He rarely invests and when he does it is serious business. Oh and it’s 102% shorted with borrow fee skyrocketing. Stop scalping and hold till $100+ at least.

Keep your eyes on CARV and ARTL. 
 
ARTL: Has a public float of only 1.9 million shares and numerous price targets of $55.00/share.  It is currently trading at $3.85.   
 
CARV has a tiny float and has a history of running hard on massive volume, but it hasn't run hard yet this year.   
 
You might want to grab a few thousand shares of each of these before they get noticed and take off.  GLTAL. Bullish

$TXMD We longs might have made lots of mistakes in owning Txmd but we got right overwhelmingly on the $10 TO rejection with the help from big institutional owners like Rubric. This kind of things don’t happen often. we’re proudly part of resistance team that saved the Company and ourselves from EW thuggish robbery and averted a BK .  
As of 11:30 AM 1.65 M shares traded at above $10:50 -11:69 ranges speaking high volumes of confidence  
IMO Rubric has the legitimate power over what the Company will do in next 30-90 days and I don’t think they’re intere 
 its own journey in TXMD business and stock with any more risks than they are currently carrying . so 90% they will push for a total ownership transaction not refinance, even refinance might be a better option for Txmd.  
Stay focused and not get distracted . Many of us could get out Txmd with less of damages a and some even make some money!!

I do believe like last time they are fake revised scam warning whispers however it’s possible they could still miss but more importantly it gives a big idea to algos what’s really going on in the economy. U have everything from Walmart $WMT  $TGT and target to $KSS khols and others so I believe market should have some pullback even if only briefly as algos analyze the data and investors do some profit taking.

$AMC is this a lottery to what the prices of APE and AMC Open at on Monday? My broker seems to be quite reluctant to provide any guidance. I hold amc accross several portfolios, one being a leveraged account (in profit with stop losses). I will remove the stop losses before Monday but will ape offset any losses on AMC in full. Best case scenario amc is at $50 by then and there won't be that concern 😂 Bullish

$AMC  Wow for each amc stock you own today you get one ape stock.

Let me clarify.

For every amc stock you get one APE stock. But............

Your amc stock will be halved in price so you gain nothing and the ape stock can be diluted.

I Would rather just keep my amc stock thanks.

Walmart Warning Won't Linger Says Morgan Stanley
When Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) lowered its quarterly and full-year profit outlook late last month, it sent a shockwave through Wall Street, and sent a slew of analysts going after the big box retailer with bear notes. Now, Morgan Stanley is saying the firm's warning might be overblown, noting a bounce in apparel sales from April and adding that its "aggressive markdown strategy is working."

$MEGL we’re not even 1/10th of the recent high, which was literally last week. Nothing has changed other then that it was shorted to hell. Float is small and most of retail purchased above $50 and have averaged down. Only a handful likely sold for a loss
