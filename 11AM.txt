$CEMI ‚ÄúCurrent tests available for monkeypox are PCR based, and given our history of developing rapid POC tests for infectious disease outbreaks, we believe we may be positioned to leverage our technology to provide a differentiated rapid solution. Based on our findings we will determine if this is a viable future opportunity for Chembio.‚Äù

Chembio has a track record of delivering testing solutions for three recent infectious disease outbreaks with the expedited development rapid point-of-care tests. 

Currently, the FDA has cleared one test to detect monkeypox, offered through the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as a lab developed test (LDT). The test utilizes a swab sample from a monkeypox lesion, creating the need for earlier detection to limit the spread of the disease and expedite treatment.

$BBBY unfortunately bears today had to close positions or average down for hefty losses, will be watching for another chance. This meme goes for the bulls as well as the bears, the bulls are writing puts and buying up all dips then bears increase position on the rip up just to have the bulls sell the puts to them and buy more shares. Then it happens again. Not to include all the call debit spreads that are being exercised after the massive move.

$BBBY be VERY careful buying weekly options. Seriously. You're a little late for that and the premiums for monthly/yearly are most likely out of your budget. 
 
At this point it's best to BUY SHARES and enjoy the ride to $80+. There will be ups and downs along the way Bullish

Taking $BLIN off of watch for now. I don‚Äôt like that mid 1.30s dip. If it recovers over 1.42 by close I‚Äôll put it on watch again. So far today, our overnights from yesterday excluding $QTEK all ran 20%+ $BBBY being an absolute monster for scalping. And finally, the overnighters I‚Äôm watching for tomorrow can bank. if BRSH falls below 1.97, I‚Äôll sell for a 4-5% loss and look for a re entry on another day

@brownsugar9901 You‚Äôre uninformed and have come up with your own random theories. There is too much wrong here to even address it.

AMC has had the ability to issue preferred shares since 2013. APE itself is not being sold but rather issued 1:1. It is basically a splividend like GME except conveniently uses a new ticker which is restricted from options to prevent the kind of fuckery that the DTCC did to $GME when they forced brokers to process it as a forward split instead of a splividend.

Further APE issuance and use for dilution, mergers, acquisitions, debt repayment or debt-for-equity swaps are just as possible as they have been since 2013. I imagine they will issue more but it would be silly to do so until the MMs and brokers have had to deal with the APE issuance conundrum. Bullish

$BBBY THE MASTER PLAN OF  RYAN COHEN RC VENTURES : Rise the cap market of BBBY to be equal to GameStop and then merge BBBY with GME to form a new bigger company called GMERICA: Warehouse of BBBY will be used as fulfillment centers, Stores of BBBY will be used as distribution centers and GameStop market place will be used as method of payment by Blockchain for all transactions to compete with Amazon. We are witnessing the formation of the Biggest Corporation in the World (Merger between $BBBY and $GME : Most of the executives at GME joined from Amazon. THIS IS HUGE 
- You guys remember on July 7th CFO Mike Recupero was said not fit at GameStop? He was released to take the position of CEO at BBBY and that‚Äôs legal and not conflicting with the Business Agreement signed of standstill signed between Ryan Cohen and Bed Bath & Beyond. Bullish
