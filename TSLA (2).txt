$TBLT When Robinhood turns on margin buying on this stock that means you’ ve got 2-3 days to get the hell out. Until then we’re safe. That’s how the Bulgarian bitch helps hedge funds avoid the abyss. They run it for a day or two encouraging people to buy more and then full scale attack to cause margin calls and big sell off’s. It happened so many times before. $RDBX, $ATER, $BBIG are just few of many. Bullish

$TBLT if ToughBuilt releases any type of good news next week it could really stimulate this rally, I would think that their management is working on some type of positive surprise news to release in the near future to act as a support mechanism for the current rally, to bolster it or further justify it. There is no denying the pull here, anybody trading the last few years has seen ToughBuilt stock come into focus at one time or another, and since there are No Options Trading activated yet on this stock, it has more room and breath to run next week to ATH. Seems like that short attack at the end of trading today signified that there is a serious situation developing here and much to be worried about if your on the short-side of this.

$TBLT A good indicator on a squeeze play that is coming to a close, is that there will start to be smart bears posting.  If you've been around awhile, you will recognize them on a play like this; like flys on a turd.  They aren't here, and these few bears that are here are not it.  This hits $15 min.  With the potential for much more.  Have a good weekend all. Bullish

$TBLT I'm in $XELA and $ENVB too and I think I've learned something from trading these three stocks. What I've learned is that it's not the intrinsic value of the company that matters. It's not even the price (buy low is relative). The most important thing is timing. It's about momentum, and other shit like that.  
 
With a cheap stock that you "believe in," you're gonna get app-happy retail traders flipping for a hundred bucks endlessly. The tutes know this and they're not gonna accumulate slowly because then they'd have to wait for it to move like the rest of us plebes. So they loan out shares to shorters in the meantime, collect those premiums, and wait for their chance to buy a fuckton all at once. 
 
Only when the little guys abandon hope, when regret has made them bitter, deformed caricatures of their former selves, can the magic happen. Profit is a transmogrification the shattered will and broken spirit of other human beings. 
 
Happy weekend! Bullish

$TBLT Only bears or sour bulls that sold will try to convince everyone of an offering, we all understand TBLT can offer shares so its not like we forgot.  
 
Momentum is building so ask yourself why would a company further dilute in the middle of a bull run? They won't, they let it continue to run until they feel they'll get the best return.  
 
This stock isn't done yet, so I don't expect an offering to happen today nor Monday if the run continues. Nothing is guaranteed but Bears will say anything to make people sell.  
 
The data hasn't changed so why should we sell here? Bullish

$TBLT Buy and Hold situation. This stock should be over $10 as long they don't dilute any more shares. When they announce the 5 to 10 new products they have to market, we will surely run. We are at a 35x revenue over shares. Add in the new products we could see 45x to 65x revenue over shares. There are not many companies can show 35x revenue over shares. The 1:150 rev split was a blessing. Take advantage of it and hold until we all get that the P/S we are looking for and it's not even close under $10. With 2.13m shares we could run to $35.20 / 75m cap the same as the Revenue of 75m!  Whenever they get the 5 to 10 new products to the market who knows where we can fly to. Yahoo Finance 1y Target Est $225.00 I don't expect that but 50% of that be nice. GLTA Bullish

 ✅  Over 150% short         
 ✅  271% Cost to Borrow         
 ✅  More than 50% of the float in fail to delivers stacked  already         
 ✅. No options chain to manipulate with         
 ✅  Almost no short share availability so naked shorts are the only option

$TBLT One more for the traders here.  If you trade on the 15 minute which is rather decent for traders.  (Please see photo below.)  We are over all Exponential Moving Averages (EMA's).  We closed above them all on the 15 minute.  That is rather Bullish short term.  Maybe some big pops and drops after.  We are also in a Bull flag here.  That is bullish!  If this flag pans out that could be a 20%-move and take us to $10. 
 
What a Bull flag does and looks like below. 
learn.bybit.com/trading/wha... 
 
If we break down...  I see a target of (34 day EMA) $7.24 on the 15 minute and a break below that is (50 Day EMA)  $6.77 on the 15 minute.

Theoretically this stock could keep doing this every day until it reaches 20 next week. Glad I am not a trapped short position on this one. Bullish
