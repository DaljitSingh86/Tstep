My thoughts on today's action  .... In my pre-mkt commentary, I mentioned how I wanted to exit my favorite energy names (OXY, FANG, PXD) into the early strength off the open. And how these names look to be rolling over. Energy names ended up getting slammed today. Guess where all that money rotated to? Right back into big cap tech. Guess what sector has the largest weighting in our indexes? That's right, big cap tech. So no wonder the mkt had a complete meltup .

Again, I continue to say this even though I've been bearish - there was just too much money on the sidelines that is now faced with FOMO. Furthermore, the mkt got caught completely bearish (short)  Throw in earnings that weren't a disaster and it has created a perfect storm. A perfect meltup. 

I did go short a semi name today, as the semis look very overbought. I didn't see this big of a move coming. It felt a bit panicky. Just when it seems everyone is turning bullish. Contrarian?

 NVDA just closed its sixth green daily candle in a row. The last time it did that hasn't been since August 2021 when it closed 7 green candles in a row. And mind you, they were all smaller candles back then than the ones we've seen this last week.  
 
This can't continue much longer, and this will reverse back to the 20 SMA at some point.

 Finally said goodbye to this one today. Lost an unspeakable amount of money here over the past 2+ years but was able to get a little bit back over the last week. Listen to guys like @ohshit. As much as he drove me nuts, he’s been right every step of the way. I may be back to play some pops but this company’s a complete bleep-show and there’s not enough bad things that can happen to it’s management team. Hope everyone here gets a massive run but seeing them walk it down today and over the last couple weeks when it touched $9+, I see what’s happening. Seen this story before and it doesn’t end well. Not a shill, just someone who sees this company very clearly now!

$MYOV
 Companies who are lacking cash and need to raise money often drop on their PDUFA date/approvals out of fear the approval will soon be followed by an offering.  With MYOV, the exact opposite is true.  They have plenty of cash on hand ($400 million) and will be receiving an additional  $100 million milestone from 
$PFE
 upon approval. 
 
$20+ upon approval.
