Plenty of room left for $AMZN $TGT $TSN and $INTC on my Top 4 list w/few others peaking my interest. No chance to lower my basis yet (high quality prob). $ALL is a mild blip on to my radar, but risk is still a bit too high for my taste. We'll see where the market goes from here. Have an awesome week. Happy Trading.

Amazon.com ( AMZN) is without a doubt one of the most monothetic American corporations to ever exist. With humble origins in the book-selling business, the online retailer quickly rose to steamroller status thanks to an incredible business model and savvy CEO. Amazon has now entered nearly every market in the retail sector, which gives it massive amounts of money.

the revenue loss was built into the price around $12.00 -$14,00. 
now with a buyback of $500 million. 358 DAU (direct active users ) at 18% increase. $4,9 billion cash on hand. Investment in augmented reality.  And mini streaming contract with hbomax which could turn i to a full streaming co tract with other streamers as well $AAPL  , $NFLX  or $AMZN  with there snap+ subscription. There is way room to grow.  I would be worried if subscriber base went down.  This company can only move forward up. Realistic. $12.59 this week. Bullish

Opinion | The Fattest 'Skinny' Spending Bill Ever
Democrats are slowly reconciling themselves to the reality that they may have to settle for passing a "small" partisan healthcare spending bill. But don't be fooled. Their definition of small has expanded like American clothing sizes, and their so-called skinny bill is an enormous expansion in the entitlement state.

Bear Market
Investors will monitor the markets to see if the past couple of

major events that can either crack this rally or fuel it further.
4000 on the S&P 500 is a major mental key level that will be

Yup, it's a hit: Jordan Peele's 'Nope' debuts at No. 1 with $44 million at box office
Jordan Peele 's UFO thriller "Nope" topped the North American charts in its first weekend in theaters with an estimated $44 million in ticket sales, Comcast's Universal Pictures said Sunday. Though it doesn't come close to the $71 million debut of "Us," it is still significantly impressive for an original, R-rated film - and the biggest of the pandemic for an original screenplay.

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen acknowledged Sunday that the U.S. is experiencing an economic "slowdown" but downplayed the potential for a recession, arguing that the country is in a period of "transition" following rapid economic growth. "The economy is slowing down," Yellen said on NBC News' "Meet the Press," adding that a correction is "appropriate" for a healthy economy.
