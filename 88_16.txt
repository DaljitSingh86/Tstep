Elon Musk is Worried about China
China controls 80% of the lithium market and Tesla needs a lot of lithium for its cars. But a junior miner just discovered a once-in-a-lifetime deposit of this "white gold."

See here why lithium could surge much higher.

$BBBY Holding from 1 week, HOPE WE SEE 100% HERE ! Im in for the big gainsss!  
  
Also on GIGM:  
  
- Company had NO debt  
- 40M$ Cash on hand (no offering needed)  
- 18M$ Market cap (1/2 of money they got on hand? lol)  
- 6M micro float (could easily go 100% up in a day)  
- 13m volume yesterday, 2M premarket right now!!  
- Nice consolidation at the moment from 3$.   
  
IMO, we will see 6$ this week. Easy 100-200% from here.. Bullish

Production Drop, Technical Factors Seen Driving Natural Gas Futures Higher Early - Natural Gas Intelligence
Riding technical momentum and drawing support from hefty declines in the latest production estimates, natural gas futures surged higher in early trading Tuesday. As of around 8:50 a.m. ET, the September Nymex contract was up 51.6 cents to $9.244/MMBtu. In Monday's session, prices rebounded after a test of support at $8.40, EBW Analytics Group senior analyst Eli Rubin observed.

$FRZA + $MEGL I don't chase, I only buy the perfect dip for a reversal like I did for GOVX when its algos hit "5% heaviness" for the day. This shows that previous play when I bought for a reversal.

Also on GIGM:  
  
- Company had NO debt  
- 40M$ Cash on hand (no offering needed)  
- 18M$ Market cap (1/2 of money they got on hand? lol)  
- 6M micro float (could easily go 100% up in a day)  
- 13m volume yesterday, 2M premarket right now!!  
- Nice consolidation at the moment from 3$.   
  
IMO, we will see 6$ this week. Easy 100-200% from here Bullish

Morning Comments: DrStoxxTrading Room 
 
Trade with us: stocktwits.com/r/DrStoxxTra... 
 
Morning all: futes are modest red on some profit-takng and weak housing numbers, but with momo strong yesterday, look for the gap to close early.  Then we can see if the numbers I mentioned hold on any pullback. It's Turnaround Tuesday: anything can happen.  We are due at least some choppy consolidation, but you never know.  On my watch list today: $xxxx got a strong reiteration from one of the top analysts after earnings last night and on verge of big breakout (smallcap semicon play). $xxxx: just hanging out above the breakout line...maybe a longer-term calls spread...maybe a shorter-term DDS.  $xxxx if it can get back on track today.  Moving $xxx to official list??  $TSLA in a world of its own, so maybe moving the shares to a call spread of some kind?  Still looking for 2.00 on the last of the $COIN calls.  $HD beat earnings so it might finally let $xxxx get a breakout move today...

$WMT inflation is the gift and a curse for corps as they raise nominal revenue through passing on higher costs to consumers. But what happens under the surface as margins erode is what you need to pay attention to. "The company also reported a substantial drop in free cash flow which slumped from $7.4BN for H1 2021 to just $1.7BN in H1 2022".
