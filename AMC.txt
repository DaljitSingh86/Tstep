 Guessing they are going to be using those 5 milly borrowed shares tomorrow, bought today at lower interest, and dark pool will be at 70%. Seen this since 2021, OG here like many.  Newcomers you might want to temper your excitement.  We've run for 3 days, we're due for some massive red dildos.  Being realistic...hoping for the best, and cautiously optimistic.

 Fellow apes, I know we have earnings tomorrow, which will undoubtedly be good, IMO, and we have AA talking about “pounce” sometime after earnings. However, as always, I believe it is good to temper expectations, and keep emotions out of it. We’ve seen hedgie use these expectations against us, and I have no doubt that they will use the 1.5 million shares they borrowed to try to control and ramp down an earnings run. I will likely add more shares after they do this. My plan remains the same, NO MATTER WHAT. Whatever happens, I will not sell a single share until I see my price target. I’ve been here since before the Battle of $8.01, and I’m not leaving until they pay. 🦍 💪🏼

 can go up its becoz noone holds it, the rich r manipulating the stocks. Noone hold stocks means no one take profit/dump when it go up to $1000. You really think 
$AMC
 and 
$BBIG
 or other memes sticks can go moon? Its hard as many retailers will dump along the way up and shorts will keep on shorting.. so when the stocks have many investors does not equal to squeeze. Market maker can manipulate the stocks and go opposite.  Sell when investors are buying, buy when investors are selling.  So i hope bbig bagsholder will sell off, so it might have opportunity to run up.

Not to mention when an analyst (probably Roth Capital who does small cap/new) initiates coverage with target of $12.   
  
 TARGETS  
  
$1.00 - penny flip compliance will get out   
  
$1.81 - gap and algos take it there, no resistance after 1  
  
$3.5 - IPO winners sell some but SP hangs on fundamentals   
  
$7 - analyst target and revenues $12 - blue sky NO resistance and great news   
  
$20.00 - crazy low float action like HKD which is most likely? Door number 3 but don't be surprised by anything 12... Blue Sky

 feels like same old shit.  They let it run knowing we have good earnings just to drop it.  Acting like the anticipation caused the run up and suddenly everyone sold.  This thing should be in the 1,000.00s.  I keep holding.
