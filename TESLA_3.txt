$TWTR >> Monthly Chart >> 

This month's candle üïØ is wedged between the 50 month moving average at 41.81 resistance level & the 100 month moving average at 34.57 support level >> 

With earnings tomorrow one of these 2 levels is on deck to break >> 

Bulls üêÇ need a monthly close above EMA 4 @ 39.91 to stop the bleeding & get a bounce going >> 

Bears üêª are looking for the 34-34.5 support zone to break & a drop to the lower Bollinger Band at 27.61 >> 

$TWTR is coming into to the Earnings Report with a very bearish üêª monthly chart >> reporting after the $SNAP disaster doesn't help >>

I guess this trade will likely come down to the Conference Call üìû& what is said about the deal with $TSLA >> 

As always it's a major gamble üé∞ holding through an ER >> 

Trade the rumor & trade the news, but holding those few minutes in between is risky 

You're either a hero or a zero >> tomorrow is options expiration Friday, so that should make this trade even more volatile to end the week >>

Here‚Äôs a nice stock indicator based on my own math :

Once you obtain the low of the yr and confirm it in this case $620.57 was on 5/24/22 !! 

Each trading day you should add $5.68 from that point -(don‚Äôt ask me how I came up with that lots math 0.02) 

We have had 41 trading days since 5/24 so $5.68x 41= $232.88
 Now you add that to $620.57 n you will reach the true intrinsic daily value including Macros factored in  $620.57 +$232.88=  $853.45 

Crazy math but all based on stats valid until 12mons from the date the low of yr ‚ÄúLOY‚Äù was recorded !

You‚Äôre welcome !!

Tesla's Simplification of Product Manufacturing Processes Continues to Advance
The simplification of manufacturing processes by Tesla for its products continues to take steps forward. The technologies it has now already put Tesla cars out of reach of competitors, but there is room for improvement yet. Yesterday, Tesla reported on Q2 2022 earnings and the CEO of the company, Elon Musk, joined the call, where he made a number of interesting remarks.

$TSLA had 2 factories operating at <10% capacity & ‚Äòburning cash,‚Äô its main factory in Shanghai closed for half the quarter with people jumping out of buildings, not to mention inflation and supply chain issues from the war, and STILL delivered $800 million in free cash flow and $2.28 in EPS. What happens when all 4 factories are running smoothly in Q4? 500K vehicles is conceivable in Q4 if they hit the 40K/week run rate Elon mentioned with 2170 cell vehicles- more than they made in all 4 quarters of 2020.

A quick trading tip for everyone  .....    

As I told members earlier today, I wasn't optimistic about SNAP's earnings. However, the option mkt was reading rather bullish. With 10 minutes left in trading, I sent out an alert to members (SEE BELOW) stating how the two biggest companies that are impacted by advertising spend  - GOOGL and META were very weak as we were closing out the day. That ended up being a big "tell". SNAP would fall 25% AHrs. 

My new Game Plan goes out Sunday. It's a big one because I analyze all the big earnings next week. For those yet to join, email me at jessielivermore1929@gmail.com 

Finding little nuggets like the one I sent to members today can give an advantage needed in this mkt. ‚úåÔ∏è

Tesla announced on Wednesday that it has sold off the majority of its bitcoin holdings after boosting the cryptocurrency last year with a $1.5 billion investment. In the electric car maker's second-quarter earnings statement, the company revealed that it has jettisoned three-quarters of its total bitcoin holdings amid a collapse of the cryptocurrency market.

Tesla Giga Texas To Pass 1,000 Cars Per Week Soon
It seems Tesla is slowly but surely ramping up production at its new factory in Austin, Texas, though we haven't heard a whole lot about the numbers. Last evening, Wednesday, July 20, 2022, during Tesla's Q2 2022 earning conference call, Tesla's CEO Elon Musk noted that the automaker expected to pass the 1,000-car-per-week milestone in "a couple of months."
