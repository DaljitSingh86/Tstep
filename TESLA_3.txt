All this talk about the bottom meantime if you really look at the overall market cycle psychology bulls are busy soft landing and barely even panicking yet since everything is “priced in” including the housing market crash that has barely even begun 🤦🏽‍♀️

$TWTR >> Monthly Chart >> 

This month's candle 🕯 is wedged between the 50 month moving average at 41.81 resistance level & the 100 month moving average at 34.57 support level >> 

With earnings tomorrow one of these 2 levels is on deck to break >> 

Bulls 🐂 need a monthly close above EMA 4 @ 39.91 to stop the bleeding & get a bounce going >> 

Bears 🐻 are looking for the 34-34.5 support zone to break & a drop to the lower Bollinger Band at 27.61 >> 

$TWTR is coming into to the Earnings Report with a very bearish 🐻 monthly chart >> reporting after the $SNAP disaster doesn't help >>

I guess this trade will likely come down to the Conference Call 📞& what is said about the deal with $TSLA >> 

As always it's a major gamble 🎰 holding through an ER >> 

Trade the rumor & trade the news, but holding those few minutes in between is risky 

You're either a hero or a zero >> tomorrow is options expiration Friday, so that should make this trade even more volatile to end the week >>

Here’s a nice stock indicator based on my own math :

Once you obtain the low of the yr and confirm it in this case $620.57 was on 5/24/22 !! 

Each trading day you should add $5.68 from that point -(don’t ask me how I came up with that lots math 0.02) 

We have had 41 trading days since 5/24 so $5.68x 41= $232.88
 Now you add that to $620.57 n you will reach the true intrinsic daily value including Macros factored in  $620.57 +$232.88=  $853.45 

Crazy math but all based on stats valid until 12mons from the date the low of yr “LOY” was recorded !

You’re welcome !!

Tesla's Simplification of Product Manufacturing Processes Continues to Advance
The simplification of manufacturing processes by Tesla for its products continues to take steps forward. The technologies it has now already put Tesla cars out of reach of competitors, but there is room for improvement yet. Yesterday, Tesla reported on Q2 2022 earnings and the CEO of the company, Elon Musk, joined the call, where he made a number of interesting remarks.

$TSLA had 2 factories operating at <10% capacity & ‘burning cash,’ its main factory in Shanghai closed for half the quarter with people jumping out of buildings, not to mention inflation and supply chain issues from the war, and STILL delivered $800 million in free cash flow and $2.28 in EPS. What happens when all 4 factories are running smoothly in Q4? 500K vehicles is conceivable in Q4 if they hit the 40K/week run rate Elon mentioned with 2170 cell vehicles- more than they made in all 4 quarters of 2020.  Santa Rally this year would be awesome! Congrats to Tesla team on the best ‘bad’ quarter ever! Bullish

A quick trading tip for everyone  .....    

As I told members earlier today, I wasn't optimistic about SNAP's earnings. However, the option mkt was reading rather bullish. With 10 minutes left in trading, I sent out an alert to members (SEE BELOW) stating how the two biggest companies that are impacted by advertising spend  - GOOGL and META were very weak as we were closing out the day. That ended up being a big "tell". SNAP would fall 25% AHrs. 

My new Game Plan goes out Sunday. It's a big one because I analyze all the big earnings next week. For those yet to join, email me at jessielivermore1929@gmail.com 

Finding little nuggets like the one I sent to members today can give an advantage needed in this mkt. ✌️

Tesla Giga Texas To Pass 1,000 Cars Per Week Soon
