$SPY $QQQ $AND $AMZN Have any more economic data tomorrow or is SNAP it? 
Lemme check for you lemmings, OH, sorry, not you, bear.

K, bull, you got UK retail sales, but like you'll listen to me on that after last weekusa database and YOU SPINüôÑ

I pounded home that 1% Core retail sales vs bad industrial production & manufacturing #s, which say LESS SUPPLY, right, products produced/manuf. SO HIGHER DEMAND for less stuff! 

But, no, you wouldn't listen to that, it was pump right thru last Friday's highly inflationary data....And no change in 0.75% rate hike to a much BETTER FOR CURBING INFKATION 1% the slightest bit? You really do got rose colored glasses AND blinders on, bull, sheesh.

ANYWAY, UK retail sales, those brits buy stuff, we'll see a NEGATIVE # because dollar so flipping high + inflation there bad as here--worse. 

There's that.

And this. You got Services and Markit PMI , the latter not as good as other PMI but that's what you got.

Services? 
Meh. Pmi? Meh.

I have no problem saying I had thought there would be some more selling before this point, with sellers offering up more resistance around (say) $SPY 395.xx but ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è we play in the world the stock gods give us.   
 
Did ok with some stuff like $AMZN for the earnings run-up (stocktwits.com/Llamado/mess...) but,  with hindsight, could have (should have?) had more risk on or held some things a little longer.   
 
Anyway, a bit of journaling and maybe counter-balance to the excessive chest thumping on this platform ‚úåÔ∏è  #stayhumble

$AMZN if anyone is wonder why $SNAP would affect Amazon.  
 
It's an ETF rebalancing domino effect. Any ETF with SNAP & Amazon will have to rebalance after a big loss.  
 
Any ETF with SNAP and any other stock that is another ETF with Amazon will have to rebalance.  
 
SNAP drags down another tech stock and that stock is in an ETF with Amazon it will need to rebalance.  
 
Amazon being on a decent bull run lately is a good place to sell for profit to cover the loss of other tech stocks.  
 
ETFs are massive part of the market. They survive on fees if they can't be a hedge against downturns no one is going to buy them.  
 
As simple as I can make it.

long day (12 hours+) in office today again, I mainly trade US Big-Cap, Index and Equity Baskets for Big Institutions on the Buy-Side at work. Was not worried about $XELA personal accounts.  
 
I want to make a few quick observations as I am heading out ... 
 
1) Nice day of solid 15 consolidations today! Its Epic ... I expect a massive Leg up to 18 to 22 tomorrow with no PR, and 40+ to open with PR. 
 
2) Interesting Apes tweets from $XELA  
3) Interesting Inside buys today 
 
4) Big $AMZN acquisition on 1life Healthcare Inc for $3.9B deal. The stock opens immediately with the new valuation this morning. Big Caps including $APPL wants to get health care industry. Remember $XELA  has twice the revenue to $ONEM, 5 to 6 times of the employee, if $MSFT acquisition offer is sweetened to $3.9B as well, we WILL OPEN at $8.88 tomorrow overnight! 
 
GL, bulls, we know how F Deep Value $XELA worth, 3.7M shares, 14.xx avg wont sell a share until $5+ Bullish

Rivian CEO eyes expansion into broader range of commercial electric vehicles
REUTERS - 10:08 AM ET
By Paul Lienert

July 21 (Reuters) - Rivian Automotive Inc (RIVN) is planning a broader range of electric commercial vehicles in a variety of shapes and sizes, and expects to be building millions of EVs a year at multiple plants after 2030, Chief Executive R.J. Scaringe said.

Speaking with Reuters ahead of Thursday's formal unveiling with Amazon (AMZN) of the large EDV-700 delivery van, Scaringe said "there will be a host of other applications in the commercial space" based on the so-called RCV platform that underpins the Amazon (AMZN) van that Rivian is building in Normal, Illinois.

"We're thinking about many other aspects of the commercial space outside of last-mile delivery (including) cargo and work vans," Scaringe said. "We've had a whole host of discussions with other customers." He didn't identify the other potential customers.

Jumia Stock: Amazon-Sized Competition Spells Trouble
Most investors don't have major gainers like TSLA or NVDA on their radar from the start. The profusion of opinions on social media and financial blogs makes it impossible to distinguish between real growth potential and pure hype.

Stocks Rise Again On July 21 As Liquidity Wave Nears Its End
The market has increased again today, which has forced me to believe that the rally I thought was coming after the FOMC meeting has arrived earlier than I expected. That largely seems to be due to the arrival and timing of how reserve balances have worked their way into the market in the form of additional leverage.

ONEM, which runs a primary-care practice under the name One Medical, for $3.9 billion, including debt. What Happened: Amazon announced on Thursday that it would acquire the San Francisco-based health care startup for $18 per share in cash.

$AMZN Re: Bezos looking at women's healthcare companies. Anyone connected with his team please inquire about Dare Bioscience being on his list. Imo it's been run into the ground despite a more than sufficient pipeline to generate a 1/2-1 Billion in revenue next year.  Major issue imo, is that the ceo and board dont seem competent to make that level of success a reality without first diluting the company which thus far since 2017 has only reduced confidence and trust to the point of jeopardizing such success.

One Medical joins Whole Foods, MGM as strategic growth buys
Justin Sullivan | Getty Images Amazon still makes most of its revenue from orders placed through its online stores, and most of its profit from its cloud computing arm. Both of those businesses were built almost entirely in house. But Amazon's largest acquisitions show the company is willing to buy growth in markets that are adjacent to its core competencies.
