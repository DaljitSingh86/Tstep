As you can see on this graph, after the breakout of the vwap we had a succession of green candles and more and more we are getting closer to the vwap with the appearance of a large green volume. In such a circumstance, we would have a high probability of a downtrend after the vwap indicator breakout by a large red candle accompanied by a large red volume.Thanks.

Netflix is in a powerful downtrend in the Daily Chart, already under the 200ma. That makes us interest in seeking short positions in the stock, however, there are technical indications that a deeper PB can happen in the coming weeks (MACD divergence), so we advise waiting price make higher highs to sell short with a better entry price.

NFLX here if it breaks above resistance may have a large bounce. Under the 500 week MA for first time since 2012 and its never been under with clear space. NDX looking quite bullish after an impulsive day and although it could be an expanding pattern, another daily close will probably confirm that the trend is now up, at least for a solid bounce. Not advice.

Looking back in history we have seen three similar drops like this one before. And prices have bounced very nicely up from that area. This is the time the rich get richer, meanwhile the poor get poorer as they close their losses instead of adding more. I am pretty sure we will go down more but it's still a good opportunity not happening very often.
