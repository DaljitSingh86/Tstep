$BBBY $100+ easy by Wednesday. The number below represents the total amount of FTD’s. Which is the total amount of shares they NEED TO BUY BACK. OVER 6.4M! Also look at the number of option calls ITM, on top of it already being heavily shorted! This was $80+ with a 120M float in 2021. We now have only 68M float. Same play like AMC was but much better.

AMC had over 220M when it went $70+ . We have a much smaller float then AMC’s now and then, this reminds me of the good old AMC days where I held $13 - $68. LOAD UP PEOPLE. Bullish

$VEEE I'd say the general outline of a sound investment approach is, first of all, you have to decide are you going to try to be an investor yourself? The answer for most people is probably they shouldn't try. You should put your money in index funds and not try to be a stock picker.

$BBBY $100+ easy by Wednesday. The number below represents the total amount of FTD’s. Which is the total amount of shares they NEED TO BUY BACK. OVER 6.4M! Also look at the number of option calls ITM, on top of it already being heavily shorted! This was $80+ with a 120M float in 2021. We now have only 68M float. Same play like AMC was but much better.

AMC had over 220M when it went $70+ . We have a much smaller float then AMC’s now and then, this reminds me of the good old AMC days where I held $13 - $68.

Another slow weekend at the box office as the new Thor film crosses $700 million globally. NYSE:AMC dipped lower to close the week of trading but the movie theater meme stock still managed to post a gain over the past five trading days.

$BBBY $100+ easy by Wednesday. The number below represents the total amount of FTD’s. Which is the total amount of shares they NEED TO BUY BACK. OVER 6.4M! Also look at the number of option calls ITM, on top of it already being heavily shorted! This was $80+ with a 120M float in 2021. We now have only 68M float. Same play like AMC was but much better!!

AMC had over 220M when it went $70+ . We have a much smaller float then AMC’s now and then, this reminds me of the good old AMC days where I held $13 - $68. LOAD UP PEOPLE! Bullish

"As we move forward into the second half of 2022, we anticipate our operating income to improve for our core gas-powered boat division. Forza X1 has successfully completed its initial public offering and Twin Vee should no longer be required to fund Forza's operations. 
 
"The net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2022, is a reflection of the investment the Company made in Forza X1. Today we completed our IPO of Forza X1, (FRZA). Forza X1 is expected to have its newly designed electric boat in the water in September of 2022. Forza X1 has selected the site for its new factory in McDowell County, North Carolina and we are currently negotiating a land purchase agreement. 
 
Net loss from our electric boat division was approximately $600,000 and the net loss from our franchise business was approximately $12,000, both for the three months ended June 30, 2022."

$POWW this is a Steve urvan power play right here. He knows the ammo manufacturing business is not going to make enough to justify growth. While gunbroker gets dragged thru the growing pains. Really classy to wait till earnings to pull this one. What are you investing in which company will you have shares in? I got a pile of powder waiting for today, I will just put it back in my pocket. This may be a great day trade today but who knows what they are doing anymore. Better blow the shit out of earnings, but I'm sure they will split it up too.

"As we move forward into the second half of 2022, we anticipate our operating income to improve for our core gas-powered boat division. Forza X1 has successfully completed its initial public offering and Twin Vee should no longer be required to fund Forza's operations. 
 
"The net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2022, is a reflection of the investment the Company made in Forza X1. Today we completed our IPO of Forza X1, (FRZA). Forza X1 is expected to have its newly designed electric boat in the water in September of 2022. Forza X1 has selected the site for its new factory in McDowell County, North Carolina and we are currently negotiating a land purchase agreement. 
 
Net loss from our electric boat division was approximately $600,000 and the net loss from our franchise business was approximately $12,000, both for the three months ended June 30, 2022."

$TNXP has great drugs in the pipeline…and company has $140M cash-on-hand and current market cap is $40M…extremely undervalued and should be trading at or near $8.00-$10.00 / per share. 

$TNXP = Huge Upside Potential and Strong Buy  🚀 Bullish

$VEEE When you block all the spam on the board you will get some great DD on our gas boats, earnings and our new EV boats that we just did an IPO on. Talk about growth and a huge increase in earnings and revenues. Also, groups love to take over floats of only 2 million shares. Insiders own 38% of the 3 ML float here. Sold buy and HOLD for GOLD ahead IMO.

So many stock market sayings and catchphrases are just annoying to hear over and over again right? Blah blah, discipline blah blah dealing with losses.  Here's another.  Know what the hell you are doing , take profit and get away from your desk.   SO $BBBY breaks VWAP anyone care if this company makes money or not?  Good, you don't.  You buy 1000 shares at 13.89 with a reasonable .25 cent stop on half and .50 on the other half.  Then it starts to go up.  You sell half at 14.50 and now use that as your stop on the rest.  If it goes to 14.75 sell a few more hundred shares and wait to see if it breaks 15 then sell some more there and put 14.75 as your stop on whatever you have left.  How's that for a saying.  MAKE MONEY!!
