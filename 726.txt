@Apetwit But yeah honestly probably a decent spot to be in for now.  
 
If I turn log scale on bitcoin was rejected at the resistance line, and did not break out and retested it like it appears in linear scale. I tend to trust log scale more.  
 
Still not quite at a spot where you should worry though but it could hit that midline. It is in support within the range as of now, t hough it looks like a bear flag, I personally don't think they are trying to crash it again right now.  
 
That stochastic RSI divergence indicator is great  to help identify divergences (the red R) + time cycles, you could have seen this coming

@Apetwit I mean kind of. Again, the channel broke, and there is a bubble/crash pattern. Don't ignore those. If you're just swinging it to 28k or whatever then you're probably fine. If you're expecting a great long term investing opportunity, it's probably not going to move much for a while.

Important News 
$HINDUNILVR.NSE  
Alan Jope, the chief executive of Unilever International, claimed that market volumes in India are falling and that the weakening of consumption is a result of the impact of inflation on Indian consumers, particularly in rural regions. 
 
My thought -People keep on supporting companies because of its increase in revenue. we must focus on, if the no of units or service provided has increased or not. The revenue can also be increased by increasing the selling price, thus one must analyze this deeply that the growth is because of increase in selling price or no of units sold before taking any investment decision.

@MasterEgg A rare meaningful conversation on RKT forum. 
(·µíÃ§Ãë ‚ÇÄÃë ·µíÃ§Ãë)wow!*‚ú∞  
 
A lot of good points ~! And I can relate in hoping for no more surprises ... 
 
I don't anticipate having a long position in RKT so it's not a huge part of my investment thesis here. Rather, the main reason I cited the dot plot is to poke some fun at OP claims since my opinion here is quite unpopular among bulls ~ 
 
My long position in fin sector remains WFC, JPM where we can see increasing rates already having positive, bullish effect in ER income statement.

READ THIS WELL, ‚Äúone time increase‚Äù!!!! So Q2 they will have 20 million more left over. If Q1 had net income of -(5) mil, this Q2 they will have a +15 mil income!!!!!

*
Net loss from continuing operations for the first quarter 2022 was $40.5 million compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $19.9 million in the first quarter of 2021. The increase in Net loss in 2022 is primarily due to transaction and public company readiness costs along with stock compensation and other one-time expenses associated with the public transaction.

$SPY $MSFT Here's how I identified the zone 
 
So for a Support / Resistance to be strong, that level must have acted as both support and resistance in the past for a few times. 
 
Now on a higher timeframe the zone can be too  big for intra-day traders so that is where you need to drill down afterwards 
 
The remaining juice and intra day level will be all be in Real-Time-Analysis.

@Profit_Maker @mylar01 Post-market doesn't mean much, but so far, switching from SOXS to BOIL is gaining more than 5% vs sitting tight with SOXS. As long as the white 13hr EMA stays above the red 34hr EMA, I'll hang on to BOIL. If BOIL rolls over, I can quickly switch to KOLD or DRIP or whatever looks promising. I'm a whore - will jump on whatever pays well. Bullish

@lordofgnomes0 @AABBKing Here ya, this is 2018 full year chart.  You can see that it ran up on good news and business developments, but an OTC stock with constant driving forces will get beat down by MM's.  This is simply the model.  It's ridiculous, illegal, and overlooked.  The only way to break the cycle is to leave the OTC or upgrade to a higher tier.  Even OTCQB will have more scrutiny as it comes with more reporting.  I think our next big push will break the cycle.  An audit and shares retirement oughta do the trick! Bullish

He can‚Äôt even get 50 followers cause everyone that sees his posts knows he has no wins under his belt.

@cielo1 You‚Äôre welcome.  Noticed that the ema has provided advice but not seeing record of application yet.  Even if accelerated, the process can take up to 150 days.  Considering colder months and the flu season are fast approaching in the West, let‚Äôs hope the process can be done sooner, and perhaps that‚Äôs part of the ema advice to help them make a decision quicker.  Paxlovid didn‚Äôt start p1 clinical trials until Feb/21 and got ema conditional marketing approval in Jan/22. 
 
And that‚Äôs before all these new emerging variants entered the picture, but sure, existing vaccines aren‚Äôt as effective against these newer variants, but Paxlovid, hey, we‚Äôre talking about a pill here, and pills are good for you.

@Zack1980 @QuickStudy @1nv3stG4mbl3r here it is, Yanamani ceased to be president of XELA (See the 8k from today). But no replacement for him announced. This really smells like a buy out.  
 
His new position was sold as a promotion, but this is no doubt a downgrade, despite his salary remaining more or less the same.

Because the same algos, HFTs and retail in May are in it today. It could run big today, to $3. See 30-min chart from May 21-23 below.

$MMTLP you guys know you got the can kick.  No way this goes public with 800k dollars and a promise from mmat for $5m. They need 20m just to fill this year's wells,  and probably about another 20m to get this company off the ground.  S1/a coming with your offering or some nice dilutive funding to chip up your divy into little pieces.  True,  would be a happy day to see this go private,  but facts is facts is a public company coming.  Says in plain English,  but those who don't read English you could Google translate it.  If it was private I would post hahaha about 50 times a day here.  Lol.  My idea, hold my last 10 shares see what happens for nostalgia sake

Nifty fell for the second consecutive session on July 26th but closed at almost the intra day low contrary to the previous day when it closed much above the intra day low. At close, Nifty was down 0.88% or 147 points at 16,484. Nifty has breached the near term low of 16,483 but closed around there. 16,359 is the next support for the Nifty while 16,521-16,564 band could offer resistance. Traders seem to be looking to cut long positions ahead of the US Fed meet outcome. Thursday could be a volatile day for India. Three Nifty companies, Bajaj finance, Maruti and Tata motors are going to declare their quarterly numbers today.

Clarification of what I expected Zach to do...

Share Buybacks as Promised, as well as increase the amounts to the CA$108 million as promised.

Contact the SIPC, NASDAQ, SEC about the 435.5million FTDs.
or if you go back to Sept 2019 about 604million FTD
SIPC because they insure brokerages if the VOYAGER!
NASDAQ because they have the Value Rule & if they are Cheating to keep the value low, it is CORRUPTION!
SEC to let them know everyone sees their Corruption by ignoring the DARK POOL corruption & shorting practices

Last thing would've been GET THE Q@ ER out by the 22nd.

ALL WOULD'VE FIXED THE SHARE PRICE!

$QQQ - Going into tomorrow  
 
Don't forget to follow for these updates! 
 
297.30 will be a level of interest.  299.00 is also an area to look out for as it serves as a resistance. Price action is still below the 26-day EMA on the 4-hour time frame therefore you can expect consolidation between 297.30 and 299.00. And this is consolidation will be either before an upside or downside move. On the daily time frame, we are re-testing that 26-day EMA, so we'll find out tomorrow if we hold above it. Overall, I am still bearish on $TQQQ medium term but as a trader volatility is our best friend so a few minutes to an hour is all we need with supportive volume present. $SQQQ

@ihaterkt Just trust in FED dot plot. They're the ones making the decision, not speculators. 
 
If you think rates are going to be cut from current 1.58% you need a dose of reality. You don't fight inflation with low rates. It's going to double to 3.5% in 2023. 
 
That said, 30-year mortgage rates might stabilize / fall below 5% over time. Doubt we see the average drop below 4% within next 5 years.

$ZY $AMRS $DNA I find it interesting that since the acquisition announcement stating the conversion of one $ZY for 0.9179 shares of $DNA, the market has not yet traded at that ratio.  Instead it has been trading at fairly consistent ratio of about 0.85.  So Cathie, who spent all day buying $DNA and not buying any $ZY at its nominally discounted price, must think the deal will be drastically revised or fail (and for Zymergen to fail/BK with it) with a likelihood of at least one in fourteen (0.9179/(0.9179-0.85))?

$PUBM So I've now seen more than 10 advertisements for PubMatic over the last few days.  As an investor in this company, and in ad tech for years, I understand how targeted advertising works.  I've searched PUBM ad nauseum as of late (but no more than usual as I keep constant track of all my investments).  I realize that if that were any other product/business, ads would be targeted for me constantly.  What's different now is, I have never seen an ad tech company advertising itself to me... Prediction, which probably won't come as a shock to anyone who's seen me post on here before, is that PUBM comes out of this downturn (which as Google just proved is not as bad as pundits want us to believe) gaining significant market share because its extreme net cash position is allowing it to advertise like crazy and poach talent from others who feel coerced into freezing hiring or laying people off because of the media saying we are heading for the next depression.

@Buckthetrend42 these little suckers are the backbone of the cash flow though. I‚Äôll sell a 1-2 DTE put like 20 delta or so with my 1h trend. And then cover my losses there with shares. I end up moving a tremendous amount of premium just that way, about a grand a week on average just doing that trade over and over and over. I‚Äôm not sure how much I‚Äôll end up keeping on average..,, it‚Äôll take like a few cycles of accumulation and distribution to get that data and feel confident in it.

@ThisIsSooooRAD @StockTraderCapital  If it's not a "scam" it's effectively a scam...  or one of the worst run companies in history that benefits the CEO as if it was a successful company.

 I'll be interested in how far they take this gun detection. They've already got kind of a sideline protection in place called " the gift"  So you can't really insult the gun detection ROSA gifts or you'll be insulting a charity. ** How can you gift something this never been tested or proven at all?

 It was really interesting seeing yesterday how quickly Steve discounted the Dallas shooting stating those units were removed.  But we only found out they were removed after the shooting. 

God forbid what if they had a trampling at 6 flags then we would find out the Romeo's had been removed too.

 It's also interesting how huge the ROSAs are.  Must take a lot of money to install them and they probably draw a lot of power.  security cameras are never that big.

When we overlay the U.S. Dollar Index with the Russell 1000 Large-Cap Index ($WB) relative to the Russell 2000 Small-Cap Index (IWM), an interesting divergence emerges. 
 
These two charts look almost identical because they tell the same story about risk appetite. When they‚Äôre trending higher, investors are more averse to risk. On the flip side, when they‚Äôre catching lower, market participants reach for more risk.  
 
While the dollar has accelerated higher in recent months as selling pressure hits risk assets, large caps have begun to lose ground compared to their small-cap peers. This not only speaks to possible burgeoning risk appetite, but it also calls into question a defensive rally in the dollar. 
 
If investors begin to favor riskier small-cap stocks over safer, large-cap alternatives, that could put a dent in a dollar rally.

(Post 1 of 1) 
This is the 6th crypto winter since BTC launched over a decade ago. Now back in the day a crypto winter required the faithful to dig deep and HODL, since there was no global/government infrastructure being built, and the crypto haters were numerous. 
 
Today's winter is much different since governments globally are welcoming the tax revenues from the digital asset industry. Blockchain is now integral to the commercial and government landscape. Governments are implementing regulation world wide. The infrastructure for the crypto economy gets stronger every day with new construction, new investment, new regulatory structure all building the vast framework for this new economy. 
 
The days of thinking crypto is a fad or a Ponzi scheme are long gone. There are only a few crypto haters left, but they are becoming the vestiges of a time gone by before crypto became integral to the economic landscape. Bullish

While economic data around housing and real estate continues to paint a bleak outlook for the sector, related stocks have not reacted the same way. Believe it or not, homebuilders have been among the strongest groups of stocks this summer, outperforming the broader market aggressively since June.  
 
 The recent leadership is illustrated by this ratio chart of the SPDR Homebuilders ETF ($XHB) versus the S&P 500 ($SPY): As you can see, XHB is making multi-month relative highs as it just rallied back above a key level of interest against the broader market.  
 
As long as homebuilders are exhibiting relative strength, the housing market is not likely to collapse anytime soon. In fact, since the market is forward looking, there may be a good chance that all of this negative economic data has already been discounted into stock prices.

$TSLA This is what I'm looking at. I tracked the pattern in front of the 2 preceding hyperbolic leaps and since we are talking exponential growth the scale is going to look different but the same pattern is emerging.  
A big pop followed by a sell off, recover half way, bigger drop, to the moon. 
The first time was split adjusted 140-888 run from end to end. 
The second time 605-1233 run end to end. 
Third time we are at the moon gate. If this pattern holds we are looking at a 600-800 dollar move in a very short amount of time. Bullish

Today, the SPDR Communication Sector ETF ($XLC) fell 2% and is pressing against new lows. After being rejected at a multi-year resistance zone, XLC is on the verge of resolving lower from a bear flag. These formations typically tend to resolve in the direction of the underlying trend. When they do, it tells us the trend is persisting. 
 
This is what we‚Äôre seeing from the weakest areas right now as they were unable to catch a sustainable bid, and are now breaking down from bearish patterns. As long as this is the case, we might expect increased volatility and a fresh leg lower from these beaten-down areas.
