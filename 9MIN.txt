Maybe the bigger concern now is the House is going to giddiness stupidly sign this massive green & chip spending bill into known coming slowing globally China-led times.

Perhaps, that's what Wall Street will soon put together.

Cuz as inflation subsiding, some, a new bill looks OK to pass, enact, start new jobs, it could be blown by merica and Bifen knows politically a strong move for Dems.

But now, China showing a negative propensity for retail & factories and investment & a new bill passes into a coming global recession would actually be political suicide for dem Dems🥶

Oh, YES! Si senor, Sonora, a lot has changed in last 12 hours....
Especially for tech & green energy euphoria, DEAD in its tracks now👍

$SPY $QQQ the WH narrative of  inflation is declining is actually not true. It's just not rising as fast. For inflation to decline you'd need a negative print. So even if CPI reduced to 6% that still means everything is still 6% more expensive than it was a year ago. Add in the CPI calculation is and continues to be changed to meet political objectives . If the clowns in Washington want to keep spending money they'll have to make the CPI calculation similar to $UVXY where it's designed to go to zero.

@DebK it’s definitely lagging behind. You can’t compare it to $AAPL. A lot of mega caps are not even catching up to $AAPL recovery. But if investors switched from $AAPL even when it bottomed in June to other mega caps, they would have fully recovered and be in green even if they bought $AAPL at the leak.

Russian shells slam into eastern Ukraine, killing 3 people
KYIV, Ukraine (AP) - At least three Ukrainian civilians have been killed and nearly 20 others wounded in the latest artillery barrages from the Russian military, Ukrainian officials said Monday. The eastern region of Donetsk, one of the two provinces making up the country's industrial heartland of Donbas that has been the focus of a Russian offensive, has faced the most intense shelling.

$SPY VXX hitting near term support, insane face ripping rally for weeks, bad economic data all over the place, and retail earnings this week with consumer sentiment at all time lows. Not a great R/R here. I’m in puts for 8/31 and will hold through pain if need be. My only concern is that we’re likely headed to the 200 day or close, and I wouldn’t be shocked by some sideways consolidation. Either way, I think the better RR is to the downside. It’s amazing how euphoric things have gotten so quickly.

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon spoke to some of the bank's wealthy clients on a call Tuesday, Yahoo reported. He said there's a 20-30% chance of a "harder recession" and equal odds of "something worse." He described current risks as "storm clouds," an apparent downgrade from his June warning of a "hurricane."
