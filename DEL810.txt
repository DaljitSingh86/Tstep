 glad I went all in on this (ha well a large slice of the pie) I have been adding at the crazy low prices confident this was a stock that was going to rise like a phoenix out of the ashes of this yeats downturn. Profitable, no debt and way undervalued. Still a good price all the way to up where it was!

  One way to process these results:   the share price is about 1/2 of its 2022 peak, so the market was expecting a disappointment.  And that disappointment is now here.  So, is stock in parity with expectations at $22?    Let's hear what CEO has to say.  He's an upbeat guy with a rosy perspective.  Let's hope  he's chastened by these results and leaves out the BS on this afternoon's call. (No more than one "flywheel" reference, please).

GETY I have been following these low float plays over the last several weeks, amazed by their returns (congratulations to all of the longs that got in early enough).  If you look at them, they have all fallen precipitously since the moves, as expected.  Then-you look at  
GETY, which has held the $23-24 support line consistently since its initial move, the float is locked and borrowing rates astronomical.  I only have a small position here, given the nature of the investment, but this is definitely one to consider (IMO) if you are into these plays (high risk, momentum). Earnings released today (8/10) - it was good overall, though it does not justify the valuation.  I am not saying this stock is going to multiply from here necessarily, but it is the most enduring and curious of the ones that I have seen so far.  It is almost like the whales are waiting for this to percolate, borrowing costs to erode short sellers, and then slam this with buying pressure.

$COIN
 82 and 
$RBLX
 39. I have mention AH i will be for ER Bounce for sure tomorrow. I just want to a bit after open to have usually better price bc stop losses trigger. They open +5-10% higher and pop +5-15% more. I could have make an easy 10-15% of gains in AH and sell it 20-30 min after open as i use to do bc Shorts Squeeze. But not this time i am in SONO in AH at 18 for ER Bounce play so i will not missed it if need i will average down. SONO will be 20+ by tomorrow. GTLA

 I have no issue with sacrificing a little time for quality. 
 
There are no problems with the manufacturing, they are just learning to improve and make the equipment better. It is about the long game and being the long term winner, could even be viewed as a positive.  
Also just shows how difficult the process is for the players who are behind them.

No one following me should be surprised by this upward push in the price of 
$DIS
 shares. I‚Äôve been commenting on this for a year (see below). I commented on the move all the way down, identified the area where it would reverse, and then gave plenty of heads up on the reversal. If you got in on this, congratulations. This was a pretty easy call.
dennismccain
For an entire year I have been commenting that 
$DIS
 was going sub $100. And for a year I‚Äôve gotten hate comments. As it went below $100 I pointed out that it was time to buy despite no one knowing where the exact bottom would be. Today that window is closing fast. It may have even gone above $100 in the after hours tonight. Now no one knows if there will be another dip before these shares head higher but surely they‚Äôre heading higher. My price target on these shares is $160. But it‚Äôs not going to be a straight shot. There‚Äôs going to be a lot of congestion near $130 on the way up. When that happens, I‚Äôll simply hold on and ride through it. Options are available for entries and exits if you‚Äôre an options trader. They‚Äôre also a nice way to augment the dividend.

 Awesome results, company will be huge as we knew already but I wouldn't be surprised if the stock price sees headwinds in Q3 because of the efforts in production and basically no significant revenue. They still stick to all of their promises (never doubted it, these guys will overdeliver) but the market might react badly on this. Hope I'm wrong but I don't sell a single share for MANY years to come either way!

 I made a post last weekend about wanting to be the DFV of this stock on this board. I wonder how that dude who created the account "therealDFV" is holding up after creating it to personally attack me, which led to half this board laughing their asses off and buying more because we smelt something funny.  
 
And now Cramer is shitting on BBBY and all of us. Lol. If there was ever a signal to buy more I'd say that's it.
