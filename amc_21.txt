AMC Has Found Another Way to Upset Shareholders | The Motley Fool
AMC Entertainment , one of the largest movie-theater operators in the world, was hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. It's still struggling, losing $0.20 per share in the second quarter of 2022 despite vastly improved attendance and revenue. This helps explain why AMC might want to raise additional cash.

@Theta_Lover That's the same things Shorts said back in 2020, " $AMC is going bankrupt",  when $AMC  was trading at $3 and in early Jan. 2021 when I was holding X,XXX shares at a $2.14 average. Now I'm debt-free, holding more than X,XXX shares of $AMC, $AMC is better fundamentally across the board, and over 2 years later Shorts are still losing and haven't covered. I'll take my chances and say, "You're wrong". Bullish

$GCT Well, this stock has not disappointed anyone but the bears.  The hype and excitement are coming in hard tomorrow morning.  If premarket breaks $100, my target will just move up to $200.  These low float IPO's can do wild things rather quickly. 
 
 Again,  we have a little over half the float MEGL did. If, we just halted up again all day we will have to evaluate it. That to me means no ones selling for peanuts here.  This could hypothetically hit $400-$500 based on how MEGL traded MEGL alone.   
 
This is going to be WILD people!  Make sure you keep focused and best of luck.

$GCT this company is already generating mega income. It’s solid. Low float. The IPO date got messed up. Brokers started trading it late.  AND THIS is why I think the stock will continue to RUN higher. Friday was a blood bath and this stock was up nearly 200 percent. We may see a little pull back which will give chance for retail to buy shares. But will run green if the market is green. Frankly , I’ll buy more if it’s red in ore market as it’s an indicator of a bull run after opening.  I Guess we will see.  Good luck Bullish

$AMC @letsdoubleup  If you still believe after 18 months of AMC meteoric rises and crashes that yours is a community of AMC die-hard holders of shares loyal one to the other, then you will one day be confronted with the reality which is that you were duped and that your group of APES might very well be the worst group of investors in the history of stock market trading for not having had the good sense to sell a 20x rocket off lows with the opportunity to buy back with the collapse and follow that up with more great gains with each double or triple that followed. $4 to $20 to $7 to $14 to $6 to $36 to $26 to $72 to $39 to $57 to $14 to $24 to $13 to $32 to $10 to $28 to $18... Once in a lifetime doesn't last forever you would be wise to realize.

So if no one is selling who is buying — do you think people Are selling $GME to buy $9 shares of APE which has no intrinsic value. How much revenue is ape pulling in?? Did ape beat earnings? It’s basically $DOGE.X but only no one is gonna buy it cause Adam is turning those shares back to AMC in a year so the asset is worthless. Bearish

@ZoroLu First, $AMC is majority owned by retail investors and not tutes or management. Second, people comparing $AMC to BBIG and the TYDE spinoff forget BBIG is a start-up company with no history and had internal management problems prior to and following the split. Third, some of the other companies that fell after a split did not have strong retail support before the split was announced and many retail investor were only in it for the pump. Whereas, $AMC has a 100+-year old history, 80+% retail owned, has strong sentimental value to many retail investors, and has a strong management team. Apples and Oranges IMO. BTW I was in some of those other plays, but I notice people who point out the negative don't point out the successes TSLA, AAPL and others have had doing a split, which historically typically produce around a 25% bounce.

@ZoroLu First, $AMC is majority owned by retail investors and not tutes or management. Second, people comparing $AMC to BBIG and the TYDE spinoff forget BBIG is a start-up company with no history and had internal management problems prior to and following the split. Third, some of the other companies that fell after a split did not have strong retail support before the split was announced and many retail investor were only in it for the pump. Whereas, $AMC has a 100+-year old history, 80+% retail owned, has strong sentimental value to many retail investors, and has a strong management team. Apples and Oranges IMO.

$APE $AMC thats the biggest thing who is gonna buy APE?? Are you gonna sell and buy it between each other ?? The price of APE wont go up unless there is demand. Well what demand will there be for a $9 stock that does NOTHING. It has no value. It’s kind of like crypto. APE doesn’t make revenue it doesn’t sell anything it doesn’t make anything it’s literally worthless lol —- it’s valuable to Adam cause it means converting APE shares to AMC shares which is dilution and dilution helps AMC pay off debt but it does nothing for YOU! So tell me again how APE Price will go up unless you sell and buy between each other ??? Bearish

$AMC more than 50% of AMC holders won’t see APE in their account tomorrow me included I just know it. There has to be some legal implications of brokers not ensuring we see those shares when we should? This all seems so messy…. 😖 hoping the run waits few days for everyone to have the opportunity to make a decision on what they want to do with the APE in their account Bullish

@festo702 Actually we did pay for it. It was purchased with what we originally paid for our $AMC shares, which is why the initial cost of APE is deducted from the SP of AMC. Hopefully, you made an honest error when telling people we paid nothing for it. Otherwise, people will be disappointed to see the SP of APE deducted from their AMC SP and balance. Bullish

$AMC $APE so it’s been said by Adam himself he will dilute APE. So ask yourself what is that gonna do for APE price ?? It’s gonna tank. So why not beat Adam to the punch and sell your APE before dilution and buy more AMC you can Triple your AMC shares from 1,000 to 3,000 instantly —- don’t let Adam screw you again you don’t need two stocks. All you need is AMC Bearish

Dirty stores, disengaged store associates: Crisis at Bed Bath & Beyond
Shares in Bed Bath & Beyond, a company that was plunged into the volatile world of meme-stock trading this year,fell approximately 41% Friday, days after its share price had more than doubled. The immediate catalyst for the Friday sell-off appeared to be the same as the one that caused the brief run-up earlier in the week and well before it: activist investor Ryan Cohen.

$AMC Not only does he have an obligation but buys the orders, breaks the rules, Considering pfof, and that’s that? The guy has dark pools, he buys order flow, Everything is routed through him from a certain exchange and didn’t always obtain the best price? Wtf? Hello? Knock knock? 

investopedia.com/terms/p/pa...

What Is Payment for Order Flow (PFOF)?
Payment for order flow (PFOF) is a form of compensation, usually in terms of fractions of a penny per share, that a brokerage firm receives for directing orders for trade execution to a particular market maker or exchange. Payment for order flow is common in options markets, and is increasingly found in equity (stock market) transactions.

$AMC here is what's going to happen.. some of you are at the mercy of your broker, who knows when they will have your $APE shares available to you.. you know what happened to $BBIG right? $TYDE started trading at 4.50s (it was valued at 7-10pps).. but for many it took them one to two extra trading days for their brokers to get their TYDE shares.. by the time they got their TYDE shares it was trading at 1.20-1.30 Bearish

Dirty stores, disengaged store associates: Crisis at Bed Bath & Beyond
Shares in Bed Bath & Beyond, a company that was plunged into the volatile world of meme-stock trading this year,fell approximately 41% Friday, days after its share price had more than doubled. The immediate catalyst for the Friday sell-off appeared to be the same as the one that caused the brief run-up earlier in the week and well before it: activist investor Ryan Cohen.
